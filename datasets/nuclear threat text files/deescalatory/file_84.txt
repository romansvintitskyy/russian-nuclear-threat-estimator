Ladies and gentlemen!

I welcome you on the occasion of the opening of the 10th Anniversary Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

Over more than half a century of its existence, the Treaty has become one of the key elements of the international system of security and strategic stability. The obligations envisaged by it in the areas of non-proliferation, disarmament and the peaceful use of atomic energy fully meet the interests of both nuclear and non-nuclear countries.

As a state party to the NPT and one of its depositaries, Russia consistently follows the letter and spirit of the Treaty. Our obligations under bilateral agreements with the United States on the reduction and limitation of relevant weapons have also been fully fulfilled. We proceed from the premise that there can be no winners in a nuclear war and it must never be unleashed, and we stand for equal and indivisible security for all members of the world community.

We attach great importance to the IAEA safeguards system as a verification mechanism of the Treaty and consider it extremely important to ensure its objective, depoliticized and technically justified application.

We are convinced that all countries that comply with the requirements of the NPT should have the right to access peaceful nuclear energy without any additional conditions. We are ready to share our experience in the field of nuclear energy with our partners.

We hope that the Conference will reaffirm the readiness of all states parties to the NPT to strictly adhere to their obligations and will make a significant contribution to strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime, to ensuring peace, security and stability on the planet.

I wish you successful work and all the best.

Vladimir Putin
