Russia displays a responsible approach to matters related to nuclear weapons, and never escalates anything, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said Tuesday.

"I believe that everything that was said on this topic, everything we’ve published, confirms an obvious thing: the question of potential use of our military nuclear potential is completely tied to the corresponding clauses of the Russian military doctrine and corresponding points of the basics of state policy on nuclear deterrence. We have an extremely responsible approach to this matter, and we never escalate anything," he said on Russian TV.

The Deputy Foreign Minister noted that Russia, together with other nuclear powers, has recently reaffirmed the basic principle that there could be no winners in a nuclear war, and such war must never be fought.

"Look what is happening on the other side: they speculate on the signals sent by the commander-in-chief in the changing operational situation. We have provided necessary explanations repeatedly. They keep raising this topic endlessly in their NATO and other formats, they post animation videos online with general calculations of potential consequences of an escalation scenario with use of nuclear weapons. This is playing on everyone’s nerves, it is yet another display of the Western cynicism," Ryabkov said.

The Deputy Foreign Minister reiterated that Russia is acting extremely responsibly in this sphere, and in strict compliance with publicly available doctrine documents.
