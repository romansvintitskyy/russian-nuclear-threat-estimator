Russia can use nuclear weapons only in response to an attack - "for self-defense in emergency circumstances." This was stated in an interview with Izvestia by Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergei Ryabkov. The diplomat responded in writing to questions about how Moscow sees the dialogue with the United States on disarmament, what it thinks about the threat of nuclear war, and how it assesses the prospects for a new prisoner exchange with Washington.
“The possibility of resuming a strategic dialogue with the United States is far from obvious”
- On August 1, US President Joe Biden said that his administration was ready to quickly negotiate a new arms control system to replace START-3 , and Russia should demonstrate its readiness for such work. Is Moscow ready to discuss this topic with Washington again?

We have repeatedly confirmed that we are open in principle to serious, pragmatic and result-oriented interaction aimed at reducing tensions and risks, preventing a dangerous escalation and arms race, and strengthening strategic stability, including through arms control. We also remember very well that the START Treaty is not open-ended and should ideally be replaced by a new agreement or agreements.

At the same time, it remains to be seen whether the United States will change its deliberately destructive course and whether it will be ready to engage in dialogue on the basis of equality and take into account our interests and security concerns, working together to create the foundations of a new, more just and stable architecture of international security.

The United States has been insisting for years on China's involvement in arms control talks. Russia calls for the participation of Great Britain and France. Considering that Moscow and Washington cannot establish a bilateral dialogue, how realistic is this five-sided format? What are the plans for cooperation with those countries that are not members of the official club of nuclear powers, but possess such weapons?

— We are convinced that attempts to force anyone to engage in dialogue are counterproductive, since such interaction, whether in a bilateral or multilateral format, should imply joint interested work aimed at finding mutually acceptable results. As an illustration, I think it is appropriate to recall the attempts of the Donald Trump administration to force the Chinese side into an arms control dialogue. It looked completely undiplomatic and in some manifestations even curious. As might be expected, China did not succumb to such brutal pressure.

We do not accept such methods. We advocate that any future interaction between the nuclear powers be conducted on the basis of consensus and taking into account the interests of all parties involved. This approach is applicable to any format, both in potential contacts between nuclear powers recognized in the context of the NPT (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. - Izvestia), and with the involvement of other states with military nuclear potentials. Our priority remains the same - to involve Great Britain and France in this process as US military allies within the "nuclear alliance". At the same time, it should be taken into account that, in contrast to the dialogue on strategic stability, the possibilities for further progress along the path of nuclear arms reductions only on a bilateral Russian-American basis are practically exhausted.

- The Strategic Stability Dialogue received a new impetus after the extension of START-3 in 2021 - then in Geneva you had several meetings with your colleague, US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. By the beginning of 2022, they had transformed into negotiations on security guarantees, with strategic stability becoming one of the main topics. After February 24, this dialogue was suspended at the initiative of the United States. Will negotiations start from the same positions on which they were frozen? How realistic is the possibility of reaching agreements on nuclear issues at the same time as Russia is conducting a NMD on the territory of Ukraine ?

- Speculating about the prospects of a strategic dialogue with the United States, especially in the conditions when the Americans interrupted it, is a thankless task. Frankly, the very possibility of its resumption is far from obvious, given the recklessly aggressive policy that Washington is pursuing towards Russia. Naturally, we are monitoring some signals regarding the resumption of dialogue on the subject of strategic offensive arms, but it is still unclear what is behind them. In general, negotiations through the media are not conducted.

As for our vision of the framework of the strategic dialogue and its desired outcomes, all this is known and remains unchanged. Our idea is to develop a "new security equation" that would take into account all the factors that affect strategic stability. To this end, we strive to cover the entire spectrum of offensive and defensive, nuclear and non-nuclear weapons with a strategic potential.

- NATO refuses to enter into a conflict on the side of Kyiv, since a direct clash between the alliance and Moscow could lead to a nuclear war. How do you assess the likelihood of such a collision?

- We have repeatedly spoken out on this topic, including at the level of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. As Sergei Lavrov noted, in today's turbulent conditions, nuclear risks are very significant and should not be underestimated. However, they should not be artificially “inflated”.

We believe that one of the most important tasks in this context is to maintain adherence by all the countries of the nuclear five to the postulate of the inadmissibility of any war between countries possessing nuclear weapons. With the aggravation of the Ukrainian crisis, which occurred through the fault of the Kyiv regime and its Western patrons, this message not only has not lost its relevance, but has acquired additional significance.

The destructive course of the NATO countries to ignore our “red lines” and get involved in a confrontation with Russia in Ukraine, balancing on the brink of a direct armed conflict, is extremely risky. It is obvious that this is fraught with further escalation, up to a military clash of nuclear powers with dire consequences. This must be prevented.

- The "Fundamentals of the State Policy of the Russian Federation in the field of nuclear deterrence" states that "aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons" can serve as a reason for the use of nuclear weapons. Under what conditions is Russia ready to resort to the use of nuclear weapons?

— You quite rightly made a reference to the Fundamentals of the State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Field of Nuclear Deterrence. The doctrinal guidelines contained in this document are extremely clear: Russia hypothetically allows a nuclear response only in response to aggression using WMD against us or our allies, or aggression using conventional weapons, when the very existence of the state is threatened. The key word in both scenarios is "aggression". In other words, the use of nuclear weapons by Russia is possible only in response to an attack - for self-defense in emergency circumstances. There is no place for conjectures or fantasies here.

Washington has previously proposed to exchange Russian prisoner Viktor Bout for Americans Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner. How realistic is this proposal? When and under what conditions can this exchange take place?

- The issue of the exchange of imprisoned citizens of Russia and the United States is a very sensitive matter, which is unacceptable to be put on public display, as the current American administration is doing, in order to earn political points.

We have repeatedly called on Washington to observe the rules of "quiet diplomacy" without interfering with the competent bodies of Russia and the United States, which are authorized by our presidents to seek solutions on specific exchange options, from doing their job professionally. This is how we managed to free Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, who was serving a 20-year term in an American prison on trumped-up charges, in parallel with the transfer to the United States of student Trevor Reed, who was convicted in our country for attacking a policeman.

It remains to be hoped that the American side will refrain from slipping into propaganda and will act responsibly, following the principle of "do no harm."
