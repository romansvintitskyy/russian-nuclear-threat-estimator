Continued Western military assistance to Ukraine did not have a direct impact on Russian rhetoric.
On April 19, Lavrov merely repeated previously voiced complaints about the West and Ukraine.
Asked whether Russia was considering to use tactical nuclear weapons, he pointed out that Moscow
had initiated both the June 2021 Putin-Biden statement and the January 2022 P5 declaration that a
nuclear war could not be won and must never be fought. However, he refused to comment on Zelenskyyâ€™s warning about a potential Russian use of nuclear weapons.
