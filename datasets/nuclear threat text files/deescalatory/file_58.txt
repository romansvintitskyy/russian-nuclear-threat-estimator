Russiaâ€™s use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine is ruled out as this does not correspond to the goals of its special military operation, Russian Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Alexey Zaitsev said on Friday.

"The scenarios of our potential use of nuclear weapons are clearly prescribed in Russian doctrinal documents. They are not applicable to the implementation of the tasks set in the course of the special military operation in Ukraine," the deputy spokesman stressed.

Any provocations whatsoever can be expected from the West and Ukraine, the Russian diplomat said.

"We have to be ready for any developments in the media space and directly on the ground," he pointed out.

"Russia firmly abides by the principle that there can be no victors in a nuclear war and it must not be unleashed," the Russian Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman emphasized.
