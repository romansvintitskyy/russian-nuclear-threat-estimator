In turn, Moscow’s nuclear rhetoric softened. On June 17, when asked about Russia’s nuclear allusions, Putin claimed Moscow was only responding to Western threats. “Of course, we can hear such
[nuclear] rhetoric. Where does it come from? It comes from their own [the West’s] statements. One
irresponsible politician blurts out something, and another one follows suit at a very high level. For
example, top foreign ministry officials talk profusely on this subject. Are we going to keep silent? We
reply accordingly. Following our reply, they start finding fault with us and saying that Russia is making threats. We are not threatening anyone. However, everyone should know what resources we
have, and what we will use, if need be, to defend our sovereignty. This is an obvious thing.”
