"So, in an effort to demonstrate that we have no intention of engaging in any actions that can be misunderstood or misconstrued, the secretary of defense has directed that our Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile test launch scheduled for this week to be postponed," Kirby said. "We did not take this decision lightly, but instead to demonstrate that we are a responsible nuclear power."

In this time of tension, the United States and Russia must bear in mind the risk of miscalculation and take steps to reduce those risks, the press secretary said.  

Air Force crews test four Minuteman III rockets per year from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. The tests are planned years in advance and publicized to avoid miscalculations. The dummy warheads splash down near Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean.
