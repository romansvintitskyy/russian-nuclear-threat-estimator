Department of Defense Statement on Additional Military Assistance for Ukraine
Feb. 26, 2022 |   
The following statement is attributed to Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby: 

Yesterday, the President authorized an additional $350 million of military assistance from Department of Defense inventories, including anti-armor, small arms and various munitions, body armor, and related equipment in support of Ukraine’s front-line defenders facing down Russia’s unprovoked attack. 

This brings the total security assistance we’ve approved for Ukraine to $1 billion over the past year, and it is the third time President Biden expedited emergency security assistance for Ukraine’s defense in recent months using the Presidential Drawdown Authority. 

And, as I have said before, the U.S. is not supporting Ukraine alone. Many other countries are contributing to Ukraine’s ability to defend itself from this unprovoked Russian aggression. We, along with our Allies and partners, are standing together to continue to expedite security assistance to Ukraine, and are employing all available security cooperation tools in support of the Ukrainian people as they defend themselves against this aggression.

So, our commitments and deliveries continue as a sign of our unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
