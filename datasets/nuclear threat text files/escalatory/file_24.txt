MOSCOW. March 9 (Interfax) - Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has described as undesirable and potentially dangerous the scenario of the possible use of airfields in other countries to support Ukraine.

Journalists asked Peskov at a press briefing on Wednesday to comment on Poland's plans to provide Ukraine with MiG aircraft.

"The Defense Ministry has already commented on the possibility of using any other airfields for takeoffs of military planes. This is an extremely undesirable and potentially dangerous scenario," he said.
