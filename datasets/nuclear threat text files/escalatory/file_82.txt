The Air Force conducted another successful hypersonic test off the Southern California coast on July 12, 2022. The Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon Booster Test Flight-3 was the 12th flight for the program and third release demonstration. The AGM-183A weapon system reached hypersonic speeds and primary and secondary objectives were met.

"This was another important milestone for the Air Force's first air-launched hypersonic weapon.  The test successfully demonstrated booster performance expanding the operational envelope.  We have now completed our booster test series and are ready to move forward to all-up-round testing later this year.  Congratulations to the entire ARRW team, your dedication and expertise are what got us here," said Maj. Gen. Heath Collins, Program Executive Officer, Armament Directorate.

ARRW is designed to provide the ability to destroy high-value, time-sensitive targets. It will also expand precision-strike weapon systems' capabilities by enabling rapid response strikes against heavily defended land targets.
