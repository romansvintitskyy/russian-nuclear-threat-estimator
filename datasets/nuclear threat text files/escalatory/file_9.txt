Nonetheless, certain Western statements could have been interpreted by Russian policymakers as
laying the ground for a direct intervention. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on February 27
that the immense costs of the war could well be the beginning of the end for Putin. She feared, however, that Putin was determined to use the most unsightly means. Thus, she urged Russia, not to escalate the conflict, but noted that the West had to be prepared for Russia trying to use even the worst
weapons.
The “long-running conflict” in Ukraine was “about freedom and democracy in Europe,” Truss noted.
“If we don’t stop Putin in Ukraine, we are going to see others under threat: the Baltics, Poland, Moldova, and it could end up in a conflict with NATO. We do not want to go there,” she warned, suggesting (intentionally or not) that the Western stakes warranted a direct intervention.3
