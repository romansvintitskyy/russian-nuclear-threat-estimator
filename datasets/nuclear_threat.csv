2022-01-27,,"A month before the invasion, the Russian leadership started to bring its nuclear arsenal into the political narrative, already suggesting an expansive interpretation of the official doctrine. Dmitry
Medvedev, the Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council and a former president and prime
minister, stated in an interview on January 27, that there was no need to review Russia’s nuclear
doctrine. Moscow had “the right” to use strategic nuclear forces “in response to an attack involving
weapons of mass destruction against us or our allies and in response to any other threat to our country’s existence, in other words, to a danger that threatens the very existence of our state.” This was “a
comprehensive formula” that made it “possible to achieve various goals,” Medvedev said.

2022-02-07,,"Ten days later, Putin continued developing the nuclear narrative. On February 7, the Russian President implied at a joint press conference with French President Emanuel Macron during the latter’s
visit to Moscow that Ukraine could drag NATO into a nuclear war. If Ukraine joined NATO and decided to take back Crimea through military means, European countries would be automatically drawn
into a military conflict with Russia, Putin said. The Kremlin understood that “NATO’s united potential”
was incomparably larger than that of Russia, but Russia was “one of the world’s leading nuclear powers” and was “superior” to “many” NATO countries “in terms of the number of modern nuclear force
components.” Putin claimed that neither he nor Macron wanted to see developments “unfold” that
way","Putin: If Ukraine attempts to take back Crimea, European

2022-02-22,,"In a televised address on February 21, Putin accused Ukraine of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons

would be a “strategic threat” to Russia","Putin: Ukraine is seeking to acquire tactical nuclear weapons, which would pose a “strategic threat” to Russia.",r,W,
2022-02-24,,"Washington was pursuing a “policy of containing Russia, with obvious geopolitical dividends,” Putin
added. However, NATO’s policy was for Russia “a matter of life and death.” The Western actions were
“not only a very real threat” to Russia’s interests but to “the very existence” of the state and to its
“sovereignty,” Putin said. Hence, he addressed “those who may be tempted to interfere in these developments from the outside,” saying that “no matter” who tried to stand in Russia’s way or “create
threats for our country and our people,” had to know that “Russia will respond immediately, and the
consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history” – what many interpreted as a veiled threat to employ nuclear weapons against those who interfered in Russia’s attempt to eliminate an existential threat.","Putin: Whoever tries to hinder Russia will face consequences

states” and had a “certain advantage in several cutting-edge weapons.” Within this clearly nuclear
context, however, the Russian President defined the preconditions for a possible nuclear strike much
more narrowly: “There should be no doubt for anyone that any potential aggressor will face defeat
and ominous consequences should it directly attack our country.” That a direct attack on Russia
could be answered with nuclear weapons was consistent with both Russia’s nuclear doctrine,
adopted in 2020, and the declaratory policies of other nuclear powers","Putin: Russia is “one of the most powerful nuclear states” and
“there should be no doubt for anyone” that a direct attack on Russia would lead to defeat.",r,W,
2022-02-24,,"Representatives of NATO countries strongly condemned the Russian invasion. On February 24, US President Biden condemned the “brutal assault [by the Russian military] on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity.” He noted that NATO would convene to “map out the next steps” to “further strengthen all aspects” of the Alliance.”25 Biden added: “Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies and reassure those Allies in the east.” However, the United States would “defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power” and the Alliance was “more united and more determined than ever.”","Biden: No US troops involved in the conflict, only to defend

the Russian President had to understand that the transatlantic Alliance was also a nuclear alliance.”","Le Drian: NATO also has nuclear weapons.

2022-02-26,,"Western statements, in turn, were accompanied by actions, which however remained limited to economic sanctions and military aid. Thus, in the days following the invasion, the United States, the European Union, many other European states, but also Canada, Japan, and Australia, adopted an unprecedented sanctions package against Russia;29 and on February 26, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby announced “an additional $350 million in military assistance” for Ukraine, “including anti-armor, small arms and various munitions, body armor, and related equipment in support of Ukraine’s front-line defenders facing down Russia’s unprovoked attack.”"," Western states decide to only impose economic sanctions
upon Russia and deliver military support for Ukraine.

2022-02-27,,"Nonetheless, certain Western statements could have been interpreted by Russian policymakers as
laying the ground for a direct intervention. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on February 27
that the immense costs of the war could well be the beginning of the end for Putin. She feared, however, that Putin was determined to use the most unsightly means. Thus, she urged Russia, not to escalate the conflict, but noted that the West had to be prepared for Russia trying to use even the worst
weapons.
The “long-running conflict” in Ukraine was “about freedom and democracy in Europe,” Truss noted.
“If we don’t stop Putin in Ukraine, we are going to see others under threat: the Baltics, Poland, Moldova, and it could end up in a conflict with NATO. We do not want to go there,” she warned, suggesting (intentionally or not) that the Western stakes warranted a direct intervention.3",Truss: Russia must be stopped in Ukraine.,w,E,
2022-02-27,,"Even more disconcerting than the decision in Minsk, on February 27, Putin ordered Russian Defense
Minister Sergey Shoigu and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov to put Russia’s “deterrence forces,” which include nuclear weapons, on a “high combat alert.” Putin cited “unfriendly economic actions” taken against Russia by Western countries, namely the “illegitimate sanctions,” and
“aggressive statements” directed at Russia as reasons for the decision.35 It was not initially clear what
specific steps would accompany this decision.3"," Putin: Russian deterrence forces will be placed on “high combat alert.”

2022-02-28,,"White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki saw the Russian decision as part of a typical pattern of the
Kremlin, artificially fabricating threats to justify further aggressive actions. Russia had not been
threatened by NATO or Ukraine at any time, she said. The United States had the ability to defend itself, but it also had to speak out against what Putin was doing, Psaki continued, noting that Washington was “open” to providing additional assistance to Ukraine."," Psaki: Announces additional support for Ukraine, but the

2022-02-27,,"Also on February 27, as a result of a foreign ministers’ meeting, the European Union announced the
delivery of weapons and lethal support to Ukraine worth 450 million euros. In a press conference, Josep Borrell, the European Union’s top diplomat, stated that this would include the delivery of fighter
jets, which Ukraine had asked for: “We are going to supply arms and even fighter jets. We are not talking just about ammunition; we are providing the most important arms to go to war,” Borell said. “We
know what kind of planes [the Ukrainian army can operate] and some Member States have these kinds of planes.”43 Borell was referring to fighter jets of the Soviet MiG or Sukhoi type, which for example Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia reportedly owned.44 Media later suggested
that several Western governments had hoped a potential delivery of fighter jets would not be made
public.

“material assistance.”","Borrell: Financial aid to Ukraine, but also military jets (MiGs).

Hence: “Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies – in the
event that Putin decides to keep moving west,” the US President said. He had made “crystal clear the

2022-03-02,,"Just one week after it had been announced, the delivery of fighter jets by EU states was put on hold – apparently also mainly due to efforts to avoid escalation with Russia. For example, at a joint press conference with Stoltenberg on March 2, Polish President Andrzej Duda declared his country was not sending “any jets to Ukraine because that would open a military interference in the Ukrainian conflict.” Poland was “not joining that conflict,” and NATO was “not a party to that conflict.” Warsaw was “supporting Ukrainians with humanity aid” but was not “going to send any jets to the Ukrainian airspace.” Stoltenberg made similar comments, noting that the Alliance had provided “different types of military support: material, anti-tank weapons, air defense systems and other types of military equipment” as well as financial support, but that NATO was “not to be part of the conflict” and was not “going to send the troops into Ukraine or move planes into Ukrainian airspace.”58 According to media reports, Slovakia and Bulgaria also rejected the delivery of MiG fighter jets to Ukraine.5","Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria, NATO will not send MiGs to Ukraine.

and other members of the international community rightly saw [Putin’s actions] as dangerous and
irresponsible and … an unnecessary step,” Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby said. “To demonstrate that we have no intention of engaging in any actions that can be misunderstood or misconstrued, the secretary of defense has directed that our Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile

regard to a possible Russian nuclear escalation. “We assume that this apocalyptic scenario [of Russia
using nuclear weapons first] cannot be realized under any pretext and under any conditions,” she said. “When it comes to the use of nuclear weapons, we have already stated our position several
times. Perhaps you are confusing us with the United States, but the Russian Federation has never spoken about this.”61
In a March 3 interview, Foreign Minister Lavrov stated that the goal of Russia’s “military operation”
in Ukraine was to prevent Kyiv from acquiring nuclear weapons. In addition, he made somewhat
cryptic comments about a possible war with the West, yet arguing that Moscow’s nuclear rhetoric
was merely a reaction to Western threats. Thus, Lavrov noted that the French Foreign Minister le
Drian had reminded the Russian leadership that France also had nuclear weapons (see February 24).
The Russian official also commented that British Foreign Secretary Truss had said “she was prepared
for conflict between NATO and Russia” (see February 27). Also, he added that US President Biden had
said that the alternative to sanctioning Russia was World War III. “I would like to draw your attention
to the fact that the thought of nuclear war is constantly running through the minds of Western politicians but not the minds of Russians,” Lavrov concluded. “I assure you that we will not let any provocations cause us to lose our balance. But if a real war is unleashed against us, this must be a concern for
those who are hatching such plans. And I believe these plans are being hatched.”6"," Lavrov: Thought of nuclear war is on Western, not Russian minds. Zakharova: Russia will not use nuclear weapons first.

address the situation in Ukraine on March 4 – with reference to the associated risk of escalation.64 In
the press conference that followed the summit, Stoltenberg condemned Russia’s “irresponsible” actions near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility. However, he stressed that NATO was “not part of this
conflict” and was not seeking war with Russia. The Alliance had a responsibility to ensure that the
conflict did not escalate and spread, he said. That scenario would be even more destructive and dangerous. Stoltenberg also said that NATO continued to believe in arms control, but that such negotiations would require a Russian regime that takes political processes seriously.

NATO states could lead to a larger war in Europe","NATO foreign ministers reject the no fly zone requested by

and disastrous consequences” – “not only for Europe but also globally.” Russia would consider the
states seeking to impose a NFZ as parties to the conflict. Similar to Lavrov, Putin also claimed that
Ukraine was trying to obtain nuclear weapons and still had relevant capabilities from Soviet times. He
described the Western sanctions against Russia as tantamount to “war,” even though “thankfully” the
conflict had “not got” to a hot war “yet.” Putin explained that Russia’s “so-called partners” understood
what a NFZ “could lead to” and how much was at stake, “despite their reckless statements, for example, like the statement made by the UK Foreign Secretary, when she blurted out that NATO could get
involved in the conflict. And we immediately had to take a decision to put our deterrence forces on
high alert” (see Truss on February 27 and Lavrov’s statement on March 3)"," Putin: A no fly zone would have “disastrous consequences.” And:

2022-03-08,,"Also on March 8, the US House of Representatives Select Intelligence Committee held a hearing to assess Russia’s nuclear threats. At that hearing, Avril Haines, the Director of National Intelligence,
stated that Russia had probably underestimated the international response to the invasion of
Ukraine. Still, Putin was unlikely to be deterred by such blowback. Instead, he might escalate further
to force a disarmament of Ukraine and its neutrality, and to prevent Kyiv from moving any closer to
the United States or to NATO. The US intelligence community assessed that Putin perceived the West
as not respecting him enough. The Russian president probably thought he could not afford to lose this
war, Haines said. What kind of victory he was willing to accept might change over time, due to the
war’s significant costs, she noted.
Putin’s nuclear saber rattling fit this assessment very well, Haines added. Nonetheless, the public announcement of a heightened alert of Russian deterrent forces was highly unusual. The United States had not seen such public pronouncements since the 1960s, Haines pointed out. But the US intelligence community had not observed any specific adjustments in Russia’s nuclear forces, going beyond
what had occurred in previous moments of heightened tensions in recent decades. Putin’s nuclear
threatening gestures were likely intended to discourage the West from providing additional support
to Ukraine, Haines said. Putin was probably still confident that Russia could defeat Ukraine and

concluded","Haines: No changes of the Russian nuclear posture, Putin wants to deter Western support for Ukraine.

In this context, Stoltenberg announced a “reset” of the Alliance’s “collective defense and deterrence for the longer term.” Above all, NATO’s eastern flank should be strengthened. Referring to the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, which had ruled out the permanent stationing of NATO troops on the territory of the former Warsaw Pact states, he stressed that today we were in a “totally different security environment.” The Alliance would not let this document “create problems or hindrance for NATO to make the necessary decisions.” In light of Putin’s nuclear threats, Stoltenberg warned, one should “not underestimate the dangers related to the military capabilities of Russia, including the will to actually use force and impulse devastation and destruction on others.” NATO would do everything necessary “to make sure that there is no room for misunderstanding in Moscow, for miscalculation in Moscow about our commitment, readiness to protect and defend all allies and every inch of NATO territory.”In addition, he explained, ministers had decided to provide significant support to Ukraine","NATO decides not to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine but

merely referred to Russia’s official doctrine, according to which nuclear weapons could be used only
in the event of an “existential threat” to Russia. There was no other reasons than the ones mentioned
in the doctrine, he stressed. Nonetheless, he avoided a definitive answer on whether Russia was considering using nuclear weapons in the current situation.111 On the same day, Sergey Ryabkov toed

The Kremlin would
never allow the destruction of Russia, he added, but warned Washington that if it did achieve what he
characterized as its destructive aims, then the world could face a dystopian crisis that would end in a
“big nuclear explosion.” Russia’s destruction could lead to an unstable leadership in Moscow “with a
maximum number of nuclear weapons aimed at targets in the United States and Europe.”115 Dmitry

radiation were to be blown into a NATO state, he reportedly added. However, according to US officials, the Biden administration so far considered the likelihood of a nuclear attack to be low. Neither
the US nor NATO had observed any military actions indicating Russia was preparing a nuclear strike,

Russia and its allies, which jeopardized the existence of the country itself, even without the use of nuclear weapons, that is, with the use of conventional weapons.” The Russian government possessed a

going to be and who is the president of Russia, it is the people of Russia who decide it during elections,” he explained. However, in the same interview Peskov also clarified and revised previous nuclear threats, citing Russian doctrine. “Any outcome” of Russia’s operation in Ukraine “of course, is
not a reason for usage of a nuclear weapon,” he said. Russia, he said, had a security concept that “very
clearly states that only when there is a threat for the existence of the state in our country, we can use
and we will actually use nuclear weapons to eliminate the threat for the existence of our country.”
“Let’s keep these two things separate ... the existence of the state and the special military operation in
Ukraine,” Peskov said. “They have nothing to do with each other.”
Nevertheless, the Kremlin spokesman also recalled “the initial statement of [Putin] … when he ordered the operation on the 24th February,” in which he warned various states “not to interfere in affairs between Ukraine and Russia during this operation.” “Everyone understands what he meant [by
that],” Peskov declared. When asked if that meant Putin would use nuclear weapons if a third country
intervened in Ukraine, he said, “I don’t think so,” although Putin had made it clear that no one should
interfere. If anyone did, Peskov explained, Russia had “all the possibilities to prevent that and punish all those who are going to interfere.” However, “no one is thinking about using, not even about the
idea of using a nuclear weapon.”

such a declaration with other nuclear powers. Lavrov meant the declarations by Russia and the
United States, as well as by the P5 states, that a nuclear war could not be won, which he claimed had
grown out of Moscow’s initiative. Referring to a statement by Polish Prime Minister Mateusz
Morawiecki that Warsaw would “welcome” a deployment of US nuclear weapons to Poland, Lavrov

statements made by the P5, never ever there could be a nuclear war. But to make sure that this
is the case, the West must discipline speakers like our Ukrainian and Polish colleagues who see

In addition, Lavrov clarified that Russia did not see itself at war with NATO, but that Western arms
deliveries were a legitimate military target for Russian forces once they reached Ukrainian territory.
We do not see ourselves at war with NATO because this is exactly another step … to increase the
risks of what we just discussed. Unfortunately, NATO it seems considers itself to be at war with
Russia. NATO and the European Union leaders ... they bluntly, publicly and persistently say Putin

As had been explained by Shoigu, the
alert had been “only about the work shifts of strategic forces commands which began to perform combat duties with reinforced personnel.” This meant that Russia had “increased its vigilance against the
backdrop of extremely confrontational statements by Western countries, including NATO member
states that possess nuclear weapons,” clarified Antonov. He concluded: Russia did not “threaten the
United States and its European allies, but, on the contrary, is making every effort to prevent the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis. … We are compelled to warn of the emerging risks associated with the
intervention of NATO states into the Russian special military operation.”
In contrast, the “current generation of NATO politicians clearly does not take the nuclear threat seriously,” Antonov complained, pointing at what he saw as “a flurry of blatant misrepresentation of Russian officials’ statements on our country’s nuclear policy.” Moreover, he reiterated claims that Ukraine had intended to obtain nuclear weapons and had a biological weapons program, while criticizing Poland’s openness to host US nuclear weapons.
Nevertheless, Antonov also highlighted Russia’s interest in reaching “agreements that will guarantee
that a catastrophic confrontation will not be unleashed,” pointing to Moscow’s efforts to restate that
there could be no winners in a nuclear war with Biden and the other P5 states. Further, he stressed
the importance of the New START agreement as a “universally recognized gold standard in the sphere
of maintaining strategic stability and transparency between the major nuclear powers,” claiming that

Senate Armed Services Committee. Putin was “preparing for prolonged conflict” during which he still
intended to “achieve goals beyond the Donbas“ as he “most likely” also judged that Russia had “a
greater ability and willingness to endure challenges than his adversaries.” Putin was “probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken,” Haines explained. In this context, she dampened hopes of a negotiated solution as long as both sides “believe they can continue to make progress militarily.” However, she warned, “Putin faces a mismatch between his ambitions and Russia’s current conventional
military capabilities.” Therefore, “the next few months could see us moving along a more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory. At the very least, … the dichotomy will usher in a period of
more ad hoc decision-making in Russia.” Current trends increase “the likelihood that President Putin
will turn to more drastic means,” including “potentially escalatory military actions,” continued
Haines.
However, Haines interpreted Russia’s nuclear rhetoric as an attempt “to deter the United States and
the West from increasing lethal aid to Ukraine and to respond to public comments of the US and
NATO Allies that suggest expanded Western goals in the conflict. If Putin perceives the United States
is ignoring his threats, he may try to signal to Washington the heightened danger of its support to
Ukraine by authorizing another large nuclear exercise involving a major dispersal of mobile, intercontinental missiles, heavy bombers, strategic submarines,” she elaborated. But: Putin “would only authorize the use of nuclear weapons if he perceived an existential threat to the Russian state or regime,” she noted. “That could be the case in the event that he perceives that he is losing the war in
Ukraine and that NATO, in effect, is either intervening or about to intervene.., which would obviously
contribute to a perception that he is about to lose the war in Ukraine,” explained Haines. She also emphasized that “with tensions this high there’s always an enhanced potential for miscalculation, unintended escalation, which we hope our intelligence can help to mitigate","Haines: Russia is using nuclear threats to deter Western supply of

nuclear weapons by the United States due to the crisis in Ukraine will become an irreversible event,

irresponsible politician blurts out something, and another one follows suit at a very high level. For

adapting Belarusian aircraft for nuclear use, he was not “talking about what we will transport tomorrow or whether they will transport nuclear weapons,” but he remembered “1941, when we were
lulled to sleep,” Lukashenko said. Putin answered that Russia was “obliged” to take care of the security of Belarus, and proposed that “the Belarusian army is armed with a fairly large group of Su-25

Ukraine, he declared that this was a policy question “for the President to decide.” The US military’s
responsibility was “to provide the President options.” Whatever these options might be, “it’s all about
deterrence. The goal is not to get into a conflict broader than the conflict that’s already going on today

NPT’s “letter and spirit,” starting “from the premise that there can be no winners in a nuclear war and
it must never be unleashed,” Putin declared on August 1.

In its prepared statement from August 2, Russia argued that the fact that “the international security
and strategic stability situation has been deteriorating rapidly” was not its fault. Moscow had been
and remained committed to “freeing the world from the threat posed by WMDs.” Russia had been
committed to security and stability, but these “positive achievements” had been “devalued” by the “US
policy of ignoring Russia’s red lines in the field of security.” Nuclear powers had to “behave with restraint and responsibility” and Moscow was “strongly convinced that a nuclear war cannot be won
and must never be fought.” Hence, it would not deploy INF systems where the United States refrained
from doing so. Also, it had “significantly reduced the role of nuclear weapons in its defense policy,
which is purely defensive in nature and is aimed at protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.” Regarding Ukraine, Russia wanted to “strongly reject all allegations.” The Ukrainian
“regime” had come to power “as a result of a coup” and persecuted the Russian-speaking population.
For eight years, “Ukrainian nationalists were killing civilians on this territory with near impunity and
preparing a large-scale military invasion of the republics that, in fact, broke away from Ukraine.”446
Subsequently, the Russian delegation also took the floor in a right of reply to talk about the nuclear
dimension of the Ukraine crisis. First, Moscow stated that it was fulfilling its obligations with the Budapest Memorandum, including “a commitment not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons.” This
was “fully implemented with respect to Ukraine, including in recent months.” Second, the Russian delegation underlined the defensive nature of Russia’s nuclear doctrine. A nuclear reaction would occur
“solely as a response to aggression involving weapons of mass destruction” or when a conventional
attack threatened “the very existence of the state.” But: “None of these two hypothetical scenarios is
relevant to the situation in Ukraine.” Third, the Russians noted that their warning was related to a
conflict with NATO potentially leading to nuclear exchanges. “Any military confrontation between nuclear rivals must be prevented, since it is fraught with the risk of escalation to the nuclear level,” the
argument went. A NATO intervention in Ukraine “would be able to trigger one of the two emergency
scenarios described in our doctrine. We obviously stand for preventing this, but if Western countries
try to test our resolve, Russia will not back down. And this is not the language of threats at all, but a
statement of what is possible – such is the logic of deterrence.”447
Media reports from August 2 noted that Russian diplomat Alexander Trofimov rejected “utterly unfounded, detached from reality and unacceptable speculations that Russia allegedly threatens to use
nuclear weapons, particularly in Ukraine.” However, Moscow could decide to use its nuclear arsenal
in response to “direct aggression” by NATO countries. Yet, Russia would only use nuclear weapons in
response to weapons of mass destruction or a conventional weapons attack that threatened the existence of the Russian state. “None of these two hypothetical scenarios is relevant to the situation in
Ukraine,” the Russian delegate said. However, he accused NATO countries of a “fierce hybrid confrontation” against Russia that now “dangerously balances on the edge of open military clash.” Such a
clash would “be able to trigger one of the two emergency scenarios described in our doctrine,” Trofimov said. “We obviously stand for preventing this, but if Western countries try to test our resolve,
Russia will not back down.”","Restatement of official nuclear doctrine and claim that none

that “in Ukraine, Russian military personnel are confronted by the combined forces of the West, who
control the leadership of this country in a hybrid war against Russia,” pointing at Western financial
assistance, weapons, training and intelligence provided to Kyiv. Somewhat cryptically, he also
claimed that the “special military operation has dispelled the myth of the 'superweapon' that the
West is supplying to Ukraine and which is capable of radically changing the situation at the front.”
These weapons “have not had a significant impact on the situation.” Further, he pointed out the “huge
loss of personnel of the armed forces and formations of the territorial defense of Ukraine.”
Shoigu also dismissed Western concerns over a potential use of nuclear or chemical weapons as “information provocations” to divert attention from an alleged US biological weapons program in
Ukraine. “From a military point of view, there is no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine to achieve
the set goals. The main purpose of Russian nuclear weapons is to deter a nuclear attack,” he stressed.
“Allegations about the possible use of chemical weapons in Ukraine are also absurd,” added Shoigu.
On arms control, he expressed concern over the “difficult situation” regarding a possible follow-on
agreement for the New Start treaty. The West’s policy did not “imply the fulfillment of treaty obligations in the traditional sense,” he claimed, and “US statements that Russia must earn the right to continue dialogue with the United States do not hold water.

2022-08-22,,"De-escalation also appeared to be on Russian minds. In an interview on August 22, Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov confirmed a restrictive approach to any potential use of nuclear
weapons. Referring back to Lavrov’ statement from April 25 that the nuclear risks were real but
should not be “inflated,” he noted that “one of the most important tasks … is to maintain adherence by
all the nuclear five states to the postulate of the inadmissibility of any war between countries possessing nuclear weapons.” In this context he condemned the NATO countries’ “destructive course” to
“ignore” Russian “red lines” and “get involved in a confrontation with Russia in Ukraine, balancing on
the brink of direct armed conflict.” This was “extremely risky” and “fraught with further escalation,
up to a military clash of nuclear powers with dire consequences,” he explained. “This must be prevented.” He then also referred to Russian doctrine, which clearly laid down that “Russia hypothetically allows a nuclear response only in response to aggression using WMD against us or our allies, or
aggression using conventional weapons, when the very existence of the state is threatened.” Hence: The key word in both scenarios is aggression,” meaning that “the use of nuclear weapons by Russia is
possible only in response to an attack - for self-defense in emergency circumstances,” he explained. “There is no place for conjectures or fantasies here.”489
Finally, Ryabkov added, Moscow remained “open in principle to serious, pragmatic and result-oriented interaction aimed at reducing tensions and risks, preventing a dangerous escalation and arms
race, and strengthening strategic stability, including through arms control.” The START Treaty “ideally should be replaced by a new agreement or agreements.” However, he blamed the United States
on the lack of progress in this regard. The resumption of bilateral strategic talks between Moscow
and Washington was unlikely due to the latter’s “deliberately destructive course"," Ryabkov: Clash between nuclear powers must be prevented.
