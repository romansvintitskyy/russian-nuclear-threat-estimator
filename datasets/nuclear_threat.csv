2022-01-27,"Medvedev sees no need to review Russia’s nuclear doctrine
Vladimir Putin approved the framework of Russia's state nuclear deterrence policy in 2020
GORKI, January 27. /TASS/. There is no need to review Russia’s nuclear doctrine because the document makes it possible to achieve various goals, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said in an interview with Russian media outlets, including TASS.

""As for reviewing the nuclear doctrine, I don’t think there is a need for it,"" he noted. Medvedev explained that all the necessary aspects were documented in the doctrine. ""We have the right to use our country’s strategic nuclear forces in response to an attack involving weapons of mass destruction against us or our allies and in response to any other threat to our country’s existence, in other words, to a danger that threatens the very existence of our state. It is a comprehensive formula that makes it possible to achieve various goals,"" the Russian Security Council deputy chairman stressed.

President Vladimir Putin approved the framework of Russia's state nuclear deterrence policy in the summer of 2020. The document he signed replaced a similar one, adopted ten years ago, which had remained in effect until 2020. The new document confirms that Moscow pursues a defensive policy in this field, particularly based on the principle of abiding by international obligations related to arms control.","A month before the invasion, the Russian leadership started to bring its nuclear arsenal into the political narrative, already suggesting an expansive interpretation of the official doctrine. Dmitry
Medvedev, the Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council and a former president and prime
minister, stated in an interview on January 27, that there was no need to review Russia’s nuclear
doctrine. Moscow had “the right” to use strategic nuclear forces “in response to an attack involving
weapons of mass destruction against us or our allies and in response to any other threat to our country’s existence, in other words, to a danger that threatens the very existence of our state.” This was “a
comprehensive formula” that made it “possible to achieve various goals,” Medvedev said.

2022-02-07,"President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a pleasure to welcome you to the Kremlin and to host the President of the French Republic, Mr Emmanuel Macron in Russia.

It appears symbolic that our meeting is taking place on February 7 (it looks like it will end on February 8, Moscow time), the day when a fundamental treaty between Russia and France was signed 30 years ago. That vital document provided a reliable foundation for the development of bilateral cooperation based on partnership and mutual respect for decades to come. Our talks with President Macron today were held in a business-like atmosphere and were substantive and meaningful.

It is clear to us that Mr President has come to Russia primarily to discuss the current issues of European and global security, for which our countries bear special responsibility as permanent members of the UN Security Council. In addition to this, France is holding the presidency of the Council of the European Union.

During the talks, we continued to exchange views on the proposals regarding long-term legally binding security guarantees, which Russia has made to the United States and NATO. I would like to remind everyone that these proposals include three key points: NATO’s non-expansion, non-deployment of offensive weapon systems near the Russian border, and the return of the bloc’s European capabilities and infrastructure to the 1997 level, when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed.

Regrettably, the replies from the USA and NATO, which we received on January 26, disregard these concerns of fundamental importance to us. Moreover, our Western partners once again said that all states have a right to freely choose their security arrangements and to enter into any military blocs and alliances. Well, we never questioned this principle. On the other hand, it is also obvious that these blocs and alliances have no obligation to admit any country that wishes to join them.

This open-door policy, which we have discussed with many of our partners, including with President Macron today, is very liberal. We believe that only the United States and possibly several other NATO members are benefitting from this interpretation of the fundamental principle of equal and indivisible security, which has been set down in many European documents and includes, as we all know, a pledge not to strengthen one’s security at the expense of the security of other states.

The reference to the open-door policy, which I have mentioned, is questionable as well. I would like to repeat (I have said this on numerous occasions, including in this very room during a recent news conference following Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban’s visit) that according to Article 10 of the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty, the member states may, by unanimous agreement, invite any other European state in a position to contribute to European security to accede to that treaty. But this does not mean that the bloc is obligated to admit any country, as I have said as well. All right.

However, I would like to point out that they continue trying to placate Russia with deliberations that NATO is a peaceful and purely defensive alliance. People in many countries, namely Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan have learned the truth of this statement the hard way, and this is also true about the large-scale military operation against Belgrade waged without a UN Security Council sanction, which is definitely not an operation that could be waged by a peaceful organisation.

In addition, we cannot overlook the fact that the 2019 NATO Military Strategy openly describes Russia as the main security threat and an adversary. NATO has designated Russia an adversary. Moreover, while advancing its military infrastructure very close to our border, NATO and its member states believe that they have a right to teach us where and how we can deploy our armed forces. They consider it acceptable to demand that we do not hold planned drills and exercises and present the movement of our troops on our own – I repeat, our own – territory as a threat of a Russian invasion, in this case the invasion of Ukraine. They claim that the Baltic states and our other neighbours feel threatened as well. In any case, this presumption is being used to pursue an unfriendly policy towards Russia.

As for the NATO member-countries themselves, they continue to pump Ukraine with modern weapons to this accompaniment, allocating substantial financial resources to modernise the Ukrainian army, and sending military specialists and instructors to Ukraine.

Mr President and I have certainly spoken about this. As you can see, it took us a rather long time: the discussion went on for nearly six hours.

For our part, we have made a point of drawing Mr President’s attention to the reluctance of the current Kiev authorities to meet their commitments under the Minsk Package of Measures and the Normandy format agreements, including those reached at the summits in Paris and Berlin.

In my opinion, it is clear to everyone that the current authorities in Kiev have set a course for dismantling the Minsk accords. There are no shifts on such fundamental issues as constitutional reform, amnesty, local elections, and the legal aspects of a special status for Donbass. The well-known Steinmeier Formula – well-known to specialists, at any rate – when we have approved certain amendments to the Minsk accords and made definite concessions, is yet to be included in Ukrainian legislation. But even these items presented by the current President of the Federal Republic of Germany – at that time, he was the German foreign minister – are not being implemented. Kiev is still disregarding all opportunities for a peaceful restoration of the country’s territorial integrity via direct dialogue with Donetsk and Lugansk.

I have directed Mr President’s attention to the widespread and systematic violations of human rights in Ukraine. Dissenting media are closed in the country and political opponents are exposed to reprisals. Incidentally, when Mr Poroshenko was the President of Ukraine, I told him that Russia was ready to grant him political asylum, if he faced problems in the future. He was highly ironic in this regard at the time, but today I would like to reiterate my offer. Despite our serious differences regarding this matter, I mean the settlement in Donbass, as well as the fact that, to my mind, he has made a lot of mistakes in this area, his persecution as a state criminal is also, in my view, an exorbitant ‘bid for success’ on the part of today’s leaders. Russia is ready to grant asylum to Mr Poroshenko and persons like him.

What worries me most of all is that they are adopting legislation that discriminates against Russian speakers, who have been denied the right to be recognised as a core nation in what is, properly speaking, their homeland, and the right to speak their native language, which is quite odd because this is in no way reflected in the approaches adopted by the European countries.

We hope that Mr President intends – at any rate, he said so earlier today – to discuss what we have discussed today as regards European security and stability guarantees at his meeting with the Kiev leaders tomorrow.

We also touched upon other topical international and regional matters.

While reviewing the situation around Nagorno Karabakh, we noted the positive role of the Russian peacekeepers who are ensuring compliance with the ceasefire regime and helping the region return to peaceful life. We reaffirmed the great significance of efforts by the OSCE Minsk Group’s co-chairs in addressing topical humanitarian and socioeconomic matters in the region, among other things. The President of France informed us of the results of his recent videoconference meeting with President of the European Council Charles Michel, the President of Azerbaijan and the Prime Minister of Armenia.

We reviewed the situation around the Iranian nuclear programme and efforts to resume the full-fledged implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, adopted in 2015 and approved by UN Security Council Resolution 2231. We agree that it is necessary to continue diplomatic efforts and to assist in the coordination of compromise solutions in the interests of preserving this highly important document. We agreed that our positions are very similar here or, as the diplomats say, they match.

Naturally, we did not overlook topical matters of bilateral relations, primarily those regarding economic interaction. Despite the complicated situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and volatility on the global markets, we underscored and noted that mutual trade grew by 71 percent in 11 months of 2021. French investment in Russia exceeds $23 billion. Over 600 French companies are operating successfully on the Russian market.

Overall, we agreed to continue our mutually beneficial cooperation in politics, trade and the economy, as well as in other spheres, including cultural and humanitarian ties.

To conclude, I would like to thank Mr President for his efforts and the efforts of France to resolve a highly acute matter linked with our relations with NATO in general, matters linked with maintaining security, creating a situation of stability and mutual trust on the European continent and, of course, resolving the crisis in southeastern Ukraine.

We have already met in Paris, and I know that, despite numerous problems facing any state leader, especially the leader of a major European state, Mr President deemed it necessary to come to Russia and to exchange opinions on how we should act in the future. I believe that, although it is still too early to talk about some of his ideas and proposals, it is possible to make them the foundation of our future joint steps.

Let us see what Mr President’s meeting will achieve in Kiev. We agreed that we will speak on the telephone after his trip to the capital of Ukraine and exchange opinions on this matter.

Thank you.

President of France Emmanuel Macron (retranslated): Thank you very much, Mr President. Thank you, Vladimir.

Mr President, you have reminded us of Russia’s views on the situation regarding the North Atlantic Alliance, Russia’s security interests and the Ukrainian issue. You have touched upon the most diverse issues. Indeed, we are now marking the 30th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations, of this bilateral agreement you mentioned.

I will not discuss relations between our two countries in greater detail at present because we now realise that the situation is serious, and all of us should find a way, a peaceful path, a path towards stability in Europe. We still have the opportunity and the time to do this. The historical and strategic dialogue that we have developed over the past years can help accomplish this. We have decided to meet in precisely this context in Moscow today.

We held very substantial, to-the-point talks. We focused on current areas of tension and on options for de-escalation, to facilitate stability and security on our continent.

Mr President, you have reminded us of Russia’s views on the situation regarding the North Atlantic Alliance, Russia’s security interests and the Ukrainian issue. You have touched upon the most diverse issues.

We can see that you have a very strong position, which does not always coincide with the European and Western position. It is necessary to underscore this. We have different views, and we need to understand and accept this. We discussed this in great detail. I believe in Europe and European unity, and this is a fundamental matter.

It is true that NATO’s open-door policy, which is very important, it is an existential matter, was adopted regarding, say, Sweden and Finland. It would be very difficult to suddenly tell them that NATO plans to change its stand.

However, we need to consider the issues you have mentioned, the series of misunderstandings and traumatic events that took place over the past 30 years, and the need to create new security and stability mechanisms in the region. At the same time, I do not think that the creation of these new mechanisms implies a partial revision of the treaties signed over the past 30 years and our fundamental principles, or a restriction of the rights of some European countries that are not parties to the existing treaties. This is an extremely important point.

Having said all this, we, nevertheless, tried to find points where our positions coincided, so as to make headway on them in the near future. Firstly, it is necessary to work very quickly to avoid any escalation. Tensions continue to rise today, and this exacerbates the risk of destabilisation. This is not in anyone’s interests.

Neither Russia, nor the Europeans want chaos and instability now that people on the continent have sustained such heavy economic and social losses from the pandemic and want recovery and tranquillity. This is why we need to come to an agreement on practical stabilisation and de-escalation measures.

We have discussed this together. This should be reaffirmed within the next few days or weeks. The result will depend on the talks and consultations with the United States, NATO and the Europeans, as well as on the outcome of my meeting with President Zelensky tomorrow.

I would like to note that President Vladimir Putin said he is ready to follow this logic and help maintain the balance in these initiatives, including the issue of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

To sum up, the next few days will be decisive and will obviously require intense discussions that we will continue together.

What should be very clear from our conversation is that reliable de-escalation calls for making headway on fundamental matters. We had a lengthy discussion on these matters. We must jointly show the will to work on security guarantees and to build a new security and stability order in Europe. It must be based on the foundation we have created together as sovereign states.

This is the principle of continuity of states. I am referring to Russia, France and the other states that are also parties to these treaties. Therefore, this is the fundamental principle of European security. We have approved them by signing the Paris Charter and the subsequent OSCE declarations. I am referring to the principle of the territorial integrity of states, the threat to use or use of force, inviolability of frontiers, and non-interference in internal affairs, as well as violations of international law, human rights and basic freedoms.

Whatever the historical interpretations of various crises and incidents may be, to maintain the security of our continent as we have said many times, we must not repeat the past mistakes.

We talked for several hours today. But we also talked about this in the past, several years ago. I understand that opinions can differ and that there can be misunderstandings and even traumatic elements. I know that many EU countries did not have the same experience in the 20th century as France did. We must not forget this experience, which has not faded away over the past 30 years. However, we cannot accept the collective risk of another confrontation between spheres of influence in Europe, another period of instability and unrest. This is creating new grievances and new threats. Starting a conflict is easy but ending it and building a lasting peace is difficult.

Therefore, I do not believe that we must choose between new rules and the absence of rules. This is optimism based on will, as I see it.

Since Russia is committed to the principle of sovereignty and related rights, I am convinced that we will be able to build security and stability in Europe, confirming what we have already achieved within the OSCE framework.

That said, we should also come up with new solutions that should probably be more innovative, as regards our ability to ensure specific security guarantees. We raised this issue directly during our conversation, respecting the interests of all our European brothers and ensuring their stability and security, as well as with due regard for the security guarantees proposed by Russia, our neighbour and friend.

I have told President Putin that I was concerned about the draft Constitution of Belarus, which is lacking two fundamental principles that were sealed in 1994. I am also concerned about the statement on nuclear weapons made by Alexander Lukashenko in December. I would like to say that President Putin has put my mind at rest regarding this.

I am indeed concerned about these matters, because they are increasing destabilisation. We should work together on practical security guarantees for the EU member states and for the regional countries, namely Ukraine, Georgia, Belarus and Russia. This is the goal we must pursue.

We had a conversation that allowed us to develop a number of proposals. I must say there is common ground between the positions of France and Russia. You were the ones to start consultations with NATO and the United States, and now we will have to continue detailed talks with all partners in the next few weeks with the express purpose of creating these new peace and security guarantees.

Russia has long asked for certain security guarantees, such as restrictions on military deployment and presence of conventional weapons, the transparency of missile defence and on intermediate- and shorter-range missiles. These Russian proposals correspond to the requirements of European states, the EU states. I am sure that a response can only be collective.

We are Europeans, but we are also allies of the United States. We have already demonstrated that we can work together, including within the framework of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. Both of us have pointed out that this format can help us make headway on these matters, in particular, on the issues of peace and security, and can help us coordinate common decisions.

The third element on which we have managed to find converging positions, which President Putin has mentioned in his statement, as I have said, is the Ukrainian conflict. I am going to Kiev tomorrow to meet with President Zelensky. Of course, we are doing this jointly with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, with whom we coordinated our positions several days ago. I will see him tomorrow afternoon in Berlin. We continue working within the framework of the Normandy format to ensure full compliance with the Minsk agreements and to achieve a complete settlement of the conflict in Donbass.

Serious agreements regarding the ceasefire regime were reached during the recent advisers’ meeting of the Normandy format countries, and now we must move forward in terms of practical steps to ensure a clear and full implementation of these agreements. We have made progress on several technical issues during the talks.

I would like to welcome President Zelensky’s efforts, the specific obligations he assumed within this format and as regards all of us. In particular, he promised to withdraw the legislation that did not conform to the Minsk agreements and President Putin mentioned this. This legislation was withdrawn at President Zelesnky’s initiative. I have also received detailed explanations from President Putin regarding the rumours about some draft laws also being proposed in Russia. He reassured us that this would not happen if they were not in line with the Minsk agreements. Now that the situation has become clear, we must continue working in this vein. This is important for peace and stability in Europe because this conflict is at the centre of the tension that we are experiencing today. And, of course, Russia and the European Union need to settle this conflict so that we can move forward in our relations.

We also mentioned a number of other matters, in particular, the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Here, I have the pleasure to say that eight prisoners were released this morning. The French crisis response centre provided an aircraft to transport them. Last Friday, Prime Minister Pashinyan, President Aliyev and I conducted a videoconference meeting. We discussed missing persons, refugees, borders, and the communications infrastructure, as well as a number of other issues that are required to ensure stability in the future.

During the talks with President Putin, we both expressed coinciding views on a number of matters. I would like to welcome the role that members of your military played on the border during the difficult period in Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Both France and Russia also play an appropriate role within the scope of the existing Minsk Group agreements.

We also mentioned the Iranian crisis, and the recent US and EU initiatives. Our positions on this score are also similar. I would rather not talk about it at length, I just want to emphasise that today, at a time that has serious implications for our countries’ collective security and peace, we were able to discuss various aspects and understand the differences in interpretation, the divergence of views, but we also found a similarity of positions. This enables us to move forward. I think we both agree there can be no rational and long-term solution without a political and diplomatic settlement.

In the coming days and weeks, there will be opportunities for additional consultations and contacts with all our European partners, with our allies, as well as with Ukraine and other countries in the region.

We will have the opportunity in the next few days to once again speak by telephone and discuss Ukraine and our collective security. We would like to build a framework of trust that would allow us to move forward. We are determined to maintain stability and peace and to restart the mechanisms of trust in Europe. This is our collective responsibility.

I would like to say that France is reaffirming its commitment to move in this direction.

Thank you.

Question (retranslated): Good afternoon, President Macron, President Putin.

I have a question for both of you.

Mr President Macron, you have been making steps towards Russia for five years now but you have had fairly disappointing results. This is evident from the crisis you spoke about and the presence of Russian mercenaries in Mali, which is fuelling anti-French attitudes and even casts doubt on our presence there. Do your actions here make sense?

President Putin, a simple question for you: do you intend to invade Ukraine?

As for Mali, can you say that your government is not connected in any way with the mercenaries in Mali?

Vladimir Putin: First of all, regarding Mali. President Macron raised this issue many times, we discussed it with him, and President Macron is aware of our position on this matter. The Russian government, the Russian state have nothing to do with the companies that are working in Mali. As far as we know, the Malian leadership has no complaints about the commercial activities of these companies.

Following the logic that may be applied to NATO, the current member states and potential members, if Mali has opted to work with our companies, it has the right to do so. However, I would like to point out – I will talk about this with President Macron after this news conference – I would like to point out that the Russian state has nothing to do with this. It concerns the commercial interests of our companies, which coordinate their activities with the local authorities.

We will take a closer look at this, but we have nothing to do with it. This is the first point.

The second, regarding the situation in Ukraine and the issues we have discussed, the issues of concern to us. I spoke about this right here several days ago, during the news conference after talks with the Prime Minister of Hungary. I would like to say this once again. We are categorically opposed to NATO’s eastward expansion through the admission of new members because we see this as an overall threat of NATO’s continued expansion towards our border. It is not us moving towards NATO but NATO moving towards us. Therefore, saying that Russia is behaving aggressively is at odds with logic. Have we approached anyone’s border? No, it is NATO’s infrastructure that has come close to us. This is my first point.

The second, why is Ukraine’s potential admission into NATO dangerous? The problem does exist. For example, European countries, including France, believe that Crimea is part of Ukraine, but we think that it is part of the Russian Federation. And what happens if attempts are made to change this situation by military means? Bear in mind that Ukraine’s doctrines declare Russia an adversary and state the possibility of regaining Crimea, even using military force.

Just imagine what could happen if Ukraine were a NATO member. Article 5 has not been cancelled. On the contrary, Mr Biden, the President of the United States, has said recently that Article 5 is a sacred obligation and will be honoured. This is fraught with a military confrontation between Russia and NATO. I asked during the above-mentioned news conference, “What are we supposed to do? Fight against the NATO bloc?” But this question has a second part: “Do you want to fight against Russia?” Ask your readers, your audiences and the users of online resources, “Do you want France to fight against Russia?” Because this is how it will be.

Our concerns also have to do with common European security.

As for Donbass, Ukrainian leaders first say that they will implement the Minsk agreements and then they denounce them and say they will never do this because “this would destroy the Ukrainian state.” I have only just mentioned this. Well, will they, or won’t they? This is the question.

They speak of security guarantees from us. But who will guarantee our security? The Ukrainian authorities have already made two attempts to settle the problem of Donbass militarily. When they failed again, the Minsk agreements were coordinated and endorsed by a resolution of the UN Security Council.

So, will they comply with the agreements or not? Or will they make some other attempt? What should we think? After all, they have tried twice, and who can guarantee that they will not try a third time? These questions require a thorough consideration by all of us.

I am deeply grateful to Mr President for discussing these matters in Moscow today. I believe that these security matters concern not only Russia but also Europe and the world as a whole.

Look, our proposals include not only NATO’s expansion, which we oppose, but also a second point: the non-deployment of offensive systems near our borders. If everyone wants peace, tranquillity, well-being and confidence, what is bad about not deploying offensive weapons near our borders? Can anyone tell me what is bad about this?

If NATO is a peaceful organisation, what is bad about returning its infrastructure to the level of 1997, when the NATO-Russia Act was signed? This would create conditions for building up confidence and security. Is this bad?

We can let the open-door pledge be, even though the issue remains on the agenda. It is a key priority for us, and I have explained why. We talked about this for six hours.

Tomorrow, President Macron will fly to Kiev. We have agreed that he will at least put forth his action plan regarding this. I am deeply grateful to him for giving so much attention to this and that he is trying to find a solution to this matter of great importance to all of us.

Emmanuel Macron: To get back to your question, I think that it is first of all France’s responsibility to have the strongest possible relationship with Russia. We are two great European nations and great world powers. We are two permanent members of the UN Security Council.

Bilateral relations are of great importance for us, firstly, to have them develop, and to have common decisions on acute international issues. We are trying to do so on the Iranian issue and attempting to find a point of contact on Libya and other matters. We do have disagreements but we still find compromise. This is obvious to me.

Secondly, I think that President Putin and I agree that Russia is a European country. Those who can see Europe should be able to work with Russia and find ways to build the future in Europe and with Europeans. Is it easy? No, but Europe was also created through difficult initiatives that had immediate effects. So, yes, we do have difficulties but we must not give up.

Finally, this is France’s mission, it is its role. During these six months we are presiding in the European Union. Our role is to make the voice of the European Union heard and take into account a variety of complex circumstances in communication with such neighbours as Russia, which plays a decisive role in our security, and listen to all Europeans as well. I have been doing this over the past days. Being here I am trying to be the person who can make a contribution to finding this proper way.

I have a simple conviction. Do we increase our collective capability for making peace without our contacts with Russia? No, we do not. Who do we leave this role for? For others.

We do have disagreements. We realise that. Sometimes we fail to move forward and it is the result of such disagreements. However, we are trying to find compromises. I consider it to be my responsibility. Our task is to make sure that these compromises protect the interests of our partners and allies. This is why in the coming days and weeks we must start this difficult work, find new decisions in order to protect these guarantees while still protecting our basic principles and our neighbourly relations, because our geography will not change. This is why we carry on.

Question: I have a question for the President of Russia. Mr President, what is your assessment of the prospects for a settlement in southeastern Ukraine? I mean, roughly speaking, do you think the Minsk agreements are still alive?

And a similar question to the President of France. As far as I understand, you have decided to spend the night in Moscow before flying to Kiev tomorrow morning, where you are scheduled to meet with Vladimir Zelensky. What message are you conveying to Kiev, given Ukraine’s recent statement about the Minsk agreements’ potential to destroy Ukrainian statehood if implemented, and France, as we know, is the guarantor of the Minsk agreements?

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Concerning the Minsk agreements, if they are still alive and if they have any prospects at all, I believe there is simply no alternative. I repeat once again, one day Kiev says that they will comply, and the next day they say the agreements will destroy their country. The incumbent President recently stated that he does not like a single point of the Minsk agreements. Well, like it or lump it, you have to fulfil them. It will not work otherwise.

They do not want to talk with representatives of Donbass directly, when clauses 12, 9 and 11 directly list the matters that should be “discussed and agreed upon with representatives of these territories.” Discussed and coordinated with them. How else can this be done? No other way. So just pluck up the courage, acknowledge what is written, stop saying that black is white and white is black and get to work.

After all, the current government’s campaign promise was to resolve the Donbass crisis peacefully.

I really do hope that this will eventually be done, when the realisation comes that it is impossible to do otherwise.

Poroshenko is also being slammed now for signing those agreements, even accused of treason. Yes, he signed the agreements, so what? The country accepted it. This was confirmed by a resolution of the Security Council.

I was not joking when I told him, you know, there will come a time when we will be granting you political asylum for humanitarian reasons. Not because we really like or liked his policy, but for humanitarian reasons. I knew it would be like this, as if I had second sight, and this is what happened. He is under investigation there now.

But all these things have to do with internal politics. I urge you to take the high road and think about the historical and strategic prospects for Ukraine’s development, its interaction with Russia, and think about creating stable security conditions for everyone, equal for all participants in international affairs.

Emmanuel Macron: To reply to you I will say a few things.

First, today President Zelensky is the President of a country on the border of which there are 125,000 Russian military. So, yes, he is nervous. And this only became news in the past few months. This was not the case in early 2021. So, regardless of everything, since you quoted his recent words, I want to say that I still think Mr Zelensky is displaying self-control in the context of international comments and this should be welcomed.

Second, when the Minsk agreements were signed, Russia’s military presence on the border was not as intensive and this is a major change in the situation. This is why this is a very important aspect of our discussion with Mr Putin. We are talking about this when we mention de-escalation. I am referring to the Russian and Belarusian borders.

Obviously, there can only be a political solution to the Ukrainian issue and the Minsk agreements are the only foundation for it. The Normandy format is the right format. Let me repeat that Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany sit at the table in this format. These agreements provide for initiatives and progress. They should move forward in the next few days and weeks. Our advisors met in Paris recently in this context. A joint communique was issued for the first time in several months. Now, the process is back on track. Some very sensitive issues on constitutional reform, on elections are now under discussion and will be developed in the near future.

I told Mr Zelensky and Mr Putin that the Minsk agreements alone can really achieve progress and settle the crisis in Ukraine. I will discuss this with President Zelensky tomorrow.

Question (retranslated): Good afternoon, Messrs Presidents.

Mr Macron, you have come to Moscow and are you speaking on behalf of France or on behalf of Europe? Mr Scholz is now in Washington. Would it not make sense to come to Russia together, as Hollande and Merkel did in 2015, to show European unity?

President Putin, is Mr Macron your only dialogue partner in Europe? You said he was a good conversationalist. Do you consider him as an intermediary to convey your message to the Europeans?

Mr Macron, could you also answer the question about PMC Wagner’s presence and whether Russia is involved in that in any way?

Vladimir Putin: I have already covered this issue.

I have already made it clear that the Russian state has nothing to do with this. I am saying this quite responsibly without any hidden agenda. Local authorities invite them at the state level, thank them for their work, and so on.

With regard to the first part of the question, I want reiterate, I have said this before, but I would really like you to hear me this time and convey this message to your readers, viewers and internet users.

Do you realise that if Ukraine joins NATO and decides to take Crimea back through military means, the European countries will automatically get drawn into a military conflict with Russia? Of course, NATO’s united potential and that of Russia are incomparable. We understand that, but we also understand that Russia is one of the world’s leading nuclear powers, and is superior to many of those countries in terms of the number of modern nuclear force components. But there will be no winners, and you will find yourself drawn into this conflict against your will. You will be fulfilling Paragraph 5 of the Treaty of Rome in a heartbeat, even before you know it.

Of course, the President does not want to see developments unfold in this way. I do not want it, either. That is why he is here and has been tormenting me for six hours now with his questions, guarantees, and solutions.

I believe his is a lofty mission, and I am grateful to him for his efforts. For our part, we will do our best to find compromises that suit everyone. There is not a single point that we consider unachievable in the proposals we sent to NATO and Washington.

There is also the ongoing issue related to the situation in Donbass. The President said that Russia is conducting exercises and has amassed a large group of forces. But has Ukraine not amassed them also? They have the same 100,000 or 125,000 troops concentrated in Donbass.

To reiterate, they have tried to resolve the Donbass issue through military means twice, and they did not conceal this as they used equipment and aviation. Who will give us guarantees that this will not happen? This is also a legitimate question on our part. This is a complex entanglement, which is why the talks took so many hours.

I hope that tomorrow the President – yes, I do understand that there are no easy questions there, he will have a hard time in Kiev, – but we agreed that after consultations with the leadership of Ukraine, we will have a telephone conversation and get some feedback about what the current Ukrainian leadership believes is acceptable or not acceptable, and how it plans to move forward. Depending on this, we will work on our own path forward.

Emmanuel Macron: First, I would like to put your mind at ease. We have very good coordination with Chancellor Scholz. I was in Berlin two weeks ago, and have exchanged views with him several times since then. We will talk as soon as we return – he from Washington and I from Moscow.

As the President of the EU Council for a six-month period, I exchange views with all my colleagues, those whom this situation primarily concerns and who are particularly concerned about it. There have been many consultations in the past few days, including two with Britain and two with the USA. The consultations were very intensive. The Chancellor will also come next week.

What I am doing now is very different from the situations in 2008 and 2014. Not a “real war,” as was the case in Georgia and Ukraine, but very serious tensions that have happened very rarely in the past few decades. As you understand, this is largely an issue between Russia and NATO. This matter concerns our collective security. We are launching this process but it is very different from the situations you are talking about. Therefore, we will extend these consultations and, based on today’s discussion, will move forward, and try to launch a new mechanism. This is because the situation is new and the response is very different.

As for the Wagner group, the President’s reply is very clear. France only recognises states and the fight against terrorism. Therefore, we make decisions on counterterrorism struggle as regards sovereign states and in close coordination with the region. In this case, we are consulting ECOWAS and the African Union.

Question: If I may, I would like to return to the topic of security guarantees. You mentioned it, but the general impression is that after NATO and Washington replied to Russia’s proposals, the subject has gone quiet. As they say in Russia, it has been played for too long and has become stale.

In this context, I would like to ask you Mr Macron, do you think the issue of giving Russia guarantees is closed for the Europeans? What ways of resolving this problem do you see?

Mr Putin, I would also ask you to clarify something. Russia has received a response. What will you do next?

I would also like to return to your words – you cited one of the arguments quoted by our partners regarding the alliance, its peaceful nature. I would also recall another argument – that NATO is a political rather than a military organisation. And one more argument – that decisions in NATO are made by consensus. So, if a number of alliance members are against Ukraine’s entry, it is not going to happen. What do you think about these arguments? What are your apprehensions in this situation then?

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: With regard to the military or non-military nature of the organisation, I think I have already covered that. The bombing of Belgrade, Iraq, Syria, the early phases of the operation in Afghanistan, and so on… Is that not military? In fact, it is as military as it gets.

Regarding the fact that a number of NATO countries are against Ukraine or Georgia joining the alliance, we are aware of that, and we have heard this many times. I have a question in this regard: if this is the case, why did these countries sign a document in Bucharest in 2008, under which they open the doors to NATO for these countries?

You know, we have tried to talk to them about avoiding certain actions for 30 years now. What we get in response is total disregard for our concerns, demands and proposals.

Yes, the President said during our conversation – I hope Emmanuel will not be angry with me for saying this – he basically said, “You yourself violated territorial integrity. You have assumed a number of obligations since 1975, including the Helsinki Act and so on, and the most recent document was adopted in Astana in 2010. It covers equal security for all. You cannot create a secure environment by violating the security of others. You yourself have violated territorial integrity. This is a pressing issue for Ukraine.”

Not quite so, or not so at all. Have we carried out any operations in Crimea or anywhere else against a regular country or a regular government? No. We have never done that. We did not even think about doing it. Why did the Western countries support the coup? From that moment on, for us, the coup, not the people’s will, is the source of power in Ukraine. Indeed, there have been iterations, including elections and re-elections, but originally the power was seized by force and blood was shed. Given the circumstances, we were forced to protect the residents of Crimea. Could we do anything else? Why put us in these circumstances?

After all, representatives of several European countries were there in 2014, put their signatures under the document and issued guarantees for the peaceful course of the political process. Three days later, power was seized forcefully.

They do not comply with anything, while expecting us to comply with everything? Let us not play this game, it is a bad sandbox. We do not like this game.

I agree though, now we have what we have. We must look for a way out of this situation. This is what President Macron and I have been discussing for several hours. We plan to continue working towards this end.

With regard to what we will do next. We will now prepare a response to the document that we received from Brussels and Washington (I informed the President about this in general terms), and send it to Washington and Brussels. There are things that we can discuss. True, they are of a secondary nature, but nevertheless. However, we will be seeking answers to key questions.

For some reason, our partners asked us not to publish their response to us. Let us face it, this sounds strange, does it not? If we sent our questions openly, why hide their response from the public in our respective countries? I am not going to discuss every item, but none of the key issues, such as the non-expansion of NATO, the non-deployment of assault systems near our borders, the rollback of NATO infrastructure to where it was in 1997, were answered even with a simple yes or no. The impression is that we did not even raise these questions. They simply let them go unnoticed. What we see there are political clichés and proposals concerning minor issues.

I do not think our dialogue will end with that. We are going to draft an answer, our vision, and send it to Washington and Brussels. President Macron was duly informed about where we stand.

Emmanuel Macron: The President’s opening remarks and his answer illustrate the existing differences, misunderstandings, and the different views that NATO and Russia have had on this issue in the past few decades. This is a fact. Because the Paris Charter that we are discussing also states clearly, in black and white the need to respect sovereignty, territorial integrity and human rights. These principles were also violated, and not by NATO. Therefore, it is obvious that neither NATO nor the USA can accept all of Russia’s demands in the context of the very significant military pressure on the border with Ukraine, as I have already said. This is further aggravated by the daily appearance of news about the start of hostilities.

I heard the President’s words and I see his willingness to move forward and find a political solution, but the tensions are very high. Therefore, searching for common ground and a political solution does not mean that we have to agree on everything. It simply means that the process has gotten underway.

Is exchanging letters sufficient to find a solution in such a complicated process? I think we have exhausted its potential. Is it possible to resolve everything by settling the issue with NATO? No, I do not believe that, either. This is a very important issue but there are also other issues that we must resolve to guarantee our collective security. We spoke about this today.

I am convinced – and this is why I am here – that we must work together so that Russia, the United States, Europeans and their allies can, first of all, leave behind the misunderstandings of the past as much as possible because they do exist, deal with our traumas because they strongly influence our views on the path Europe has taken in the past 30 years and lead to diametrically opposed conclusions, and, most importantly, find useful solutions. To me, it is abundantly clear what that means – military stability in the short term. Not a single provocation or escalation must be allowed. This is why I came here, to Moscow, and will arrive in Kiev tomorrow.

It is necessary to continue dialogue on this basis with all sides – NATO, the USA, and the EU – with a view to finding a short- and mid-term solution. What is the goal? The security of all, because there is no security for Europeans if there is no security for Russia.

This is what I heard when talking to my colleagues in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and other countries. They have the same apprehensions. They also feel the same treaties were violated. These treaties did not envisage troop deployment, but it happened.

This is why processes based on transparency and de-escalation are needed. We should do this together because we live on both sides of our shared borders. We must devote the next few weeks to these issues. In seeking security, we must also respect the sovereignty and independence of states that are not EU or NATO members but that are located in the region. This applies to Belarus, Ukraine, of course, Georgia and Moldova – the countries whose sovereignty and independence must be respected because that is also part of our collective security. We must also take this into account.

As for Ukraine, yes, we know what the framework for resolving security issues is – the Minsk agreements and the Normandy format. That said, it is also necessary to discuss openly other issues as well.

Stability and creating conditions for de-escalation will involve the development of new mechanisms based on our values and on what we agreed to over the past 30 years. However, at the same time, looking at our current differences and the existing situation, we must also find new joint solutions for maintaining stability and security.

President Putin and I reviewed several options. I will work on them, and I know he will also work on them in his replies to NATO and the United States.

We will continue and intensify this dialogue. We will talk again in a few days. We will draft new initiatives together with all participants and parties involved. I am sure we will achieve results. It will be difficult, but I am convinced it will work.","Ten days later, Putin continued developing the nuclear narrative. On February 7, the Russian President implied at a joint press conference with French President Emanuel Macron during the latter’s
visit to Moscow that Ukraine could drag NATO into a nuclear war. If Ukraine joined NATO and decided to take back Crimea through military means, European countries would be automatically drawn
into a military conflict with Russia, Putin said. The Kremlin understood that “NATO’s united potential”
was incomparably larger than that of Russia, but Russia was “one of the world’s leading nuclear powers” and was “superior” to “many” NATO countries “in terms of the number of modern nuclear force
components.” Putin claimed that neither he nor Macron wanted to see developments “unfold” that
way","Putin: If Ukraine attempts to take back Crimea, European

2022-02-22,"Address by the President of the Russian Federation
February 21, 202222:35The Kremlin, Moscow
Address by the President of the Russian Federation
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Citizens of Russia, friends,

My address concerns the events in Ukraine and why this is so important for us, for Russia. Of course, my message is also addressed to our compatriots in Ukraine.

The matter is very serious and needs to be discussed in depth.

The situation in Donbass has reached a critical, acute stage. I am speaking to you directly today not only to explain what is happening but also to inform you of the decisions being made as well as potential further steps.

I would like to emphasise again that Ukraine is not just a neighbouring country for us. It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space. These are our comrades, those dearest to us – not only colleagues, friends and people who once served together, but also relatives, people bound by blood, by family ties.

Since time immemorial, the people living in the south-west of what has historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians. This was the case before the 17th century, when a portion of this territory rejoined the Russian state, and after.

It seems to us that, generally speaking, we all know these facts, that this is common knowledge. Still, it is necessary to say at least a few words about the history of this issue in order to understand what is happening today, to explain the motives behind Russia’s actions and what we aim to achieve.

So, I will start with the fact that modern Ukraine was entirely created by Russia or, to be more precise, by Bolshevik, Communist Russia. This process started practically right after the 1917 revolution, and Lenin and his associates did it in a way that was extremely harsh on Russia – by separating, severing what is historically Russian land. Nobody asked the millions of people living there what they thought.

Then, both before and after the Great Patriotic War, Stalin incorporated in the USSR and transferred to Ukraine some lands that previously belonged to Poland, Romania and Hungary. In the process, he gave Poland part of what was traditionally German land as compensation, and in 1954, Khrushchev took Crimea away from Russia for some reason and also gave it to Ukraine. In effect, this is how the territory of modern Ukraine was formed.

But now I would like to focus attention on the initial period of the USSR’s formation. I believe this is extremely important for us. I will have to approach it from a distance, so to speak.

I will remind you that after the 1917 October Revolution and the subsequent Civil War, the Bolsheviks set about creating a new statehood. They had rather serious disagreements among themselves on this point. In 1922, Stalin occupied the positions of both the General Secretary of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the People’s Commissar for Ethnic Affairs. He suggested building the country on the principles of autonomisation that is, giving the republics – the future administrative and territorial entities – broad powers upon joining a unified state.

Lenin criticised this plan and suggested making concessions to the nationalists, whom he called “independents” at that time. Lenin’s ideas of what amounted in essence to a confederative state arrangement and a slogan about the right of nations to self-determination, up to secession, were laid in the foundation of Soviet statehood. Initially they were confirmed in the Declaration on the Formation of the USSR in 1922, and later on, after Lenin’s death, were enshrined in the 1924 Soviet Constitution.

This immediately raises many questions. The first is really the main one: why was it necessary to appease the nationalists, to satisfy the ceaselessly growing nationalist ambitions on the outskirts of the former empire? What was the point of transferring to the newly, often arbitrarily formed administrative units – the union republics – vast territories that had nothing to do with them? Let me repeat that these territories were transferred along with the population of what was historically Russia.

Moreover, these administrative units were de facto given the status and form of national state entities. That raises another question: why was it necessary to make such generous gifts, beyond the wildest dreams of the most zealous nationalists and, on top of all that, give the republics the right to secede from the unified state without any conditions?

At first glance, this looks absolutely incomprehensible, even crazy. But only at first glance. There is an explanation. After the revolution, the Bolsheviks’ main goal was to stay in power at all costs, absolutely at all costs. They did everything for this purpose: accepted the humiliating Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, although the military and economic situation in Kaiser Germany and its allies was dramatic and the outcome of the First World War was a foregone conclusion, and satisfied any demands and wishes of the nationalists within the country.

When it comes to the historical destiny of Russia and its peoples, Lenin’s principles of state development were not just a mistake; they were worse than a mistake, as the saying goes. This became patently clear after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Of course, we cannot change past events, but we must at least admit them openly and honestly, without any reservations or politicking. Personally, I can add that no political factors, however impressive or profitable they may seem at any given moment, can or may be used as the fundamental principles of statehood.

I am not trying to put the blame on anyone. The situation in the country at that time, both before and after the Civil War, was extremely complicated; it was critical. The only thing I would like to say today is that this is exactly how it was. It is a historical fact. Actually, as I have already said, Soviet Ukraine is the result of the Bolsheviks’ policy and can be rightfully called “Vladimir Lenin’s Ukraine.” He was its creator and architect. This is fully and comprehensively corroborated by archival documents, including Lenin’s harsh instructions regarding Donbass, which was actually shoved into Ukraine. And today the “grateful progeny” has overturned monuments to Lenin in Ukraine. They call it decommunization.

You want decommunization? Very well, this suits us just fine. But why stop halfway? We are ready to show what real decommunizations would mean for Ukraine.

Going back to history, I would like to repeat that the Soviet Union was established in the place of the former Russian Empire in 1922. But practice showed immediately that it was impossible to preserve or govern such a vast and complex territory on the amorphous principles that amounted to confederation. They were far removed from reality and the historical tradition.

It is logical that the Red Terror and a rapid slide into Stalin’s dictatorship, the domination of the communist ideology and the Communist Party’s monopoly on power, nationalisation and the planned economy – all this transformed the formally declared but ineffective principles of government into a mere declaration. In reality, the union republics did not have any sovereign rights, none at all. The practical result was the creation of a tightly centralised and absolutely unitary state.

In fact, what Stalin fully implemented was not Lenin’s but his own principles of government. But he did not make the relevant amendments to the cornerstone documents, to the Constitution, and he did not formally revise Lenin’s principles underlying the Soviet Union. From the look of it, there seemed to be no need for that, because everything seemed to be working well in conditions of the totalitarian regime, and outwardly it looked wonderful, attractive and even super-democratic.

And yet, it is a great pity that the fundamental and formally legal foundations of our state were not promptly cleansed of the odious and utopian fantasies inspired by the revolution, which are absolutely destructive for any normal state. As it often happened in our country before, nobody gave any thought to the future.

It seems that the Communist Party leaders were convinced that they had created a solid system of government and that their policies had settled the ethnic issue for good. But falsification, misconception, and tampering with public opinion have a high cost. The virus of nationalist ambitions is still with us, and the mine laid at the initial stage to destroy state immunity to the disease of nationalism was ticking. As I have already said, the mine was the right of secession from the Soviet Union.

In the mid-1980s, the increasing socioeconomic problems and the apparent crisis of the planned economy aggravated the ethnic issue, which essentially was not based on any expectations or unfulfilled dreams of the Soviet peoples but primarily the growing appetites of the local elites.

However, instead of analysing the situation, taking appropriate measures, first of all in the economy, and gradually transforming the political system and government in a well-considered and balanced manner, the Communist Party leadership only engaged in open doubletalk about the revival of the Leninist principle of national self-determination.

Moreover, in the course of power struggle within the Communist Party itself, each of the opposing sides, in a bid to expand its support base, started to thoughtlessly incite and encourage nationalist sentiments, manipulating them and promising their potential supporters whatever they wished. Against the backdrop of the superficial and populist rhetoric about democracy and a bright future based either on a market or a planned economy, but amid a true impoverishment of people and widespread shortages, no one among the powers that be was thinking about the inevitable tragic consequences for the country.

Next, they entirely embarked on the track beaten at the inception of the USSR and pandering to the ambitions of the nationalist elites nurtured within their own party ranks. But in so doing, they forgot that the CPSU no longer had – thank God – the tools for retaining power and the country itself, tools such as state terror and a Stalinist-type dictatorship, and that the notorious guiding role of the party was disappearing without a trace, like a morning mist, right before their eyes.

And then, the September 1989 plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee approved a truly fatal document, the so-called ethnic policy of the party in modern conditions, the CPSU platform. It included the following provisions, I quote: “The republics of the USSR shall possess all the rights appropriate to their status as sovereign socialist states.”

The next point: “The supreme representative bodies of power of the USSR republics can challenge and suspend the operation of the USSR Government’s resolutions and directives in their territory.”

And finally: “Each republic of the USSR shall have citizenship of its own, which shall apply to all of its residents.”

Wasn’t it clear what these formulas and decisions would lead to?

Now is not the time or place to go into matters pertaining to state or constitutional law, or define the concept of citizenship. But one may wonder: why was it necessary to rock the country even more in that already complicated situation? The facts remain.

Even two years before the collapse of the USSR, its fate was actually predetermined. It is now that radicals and nationalists, including and primarily those in Ukraine, are taking credit for having gained independence. As we can see, this is absolutely wrong. The disintegration of our united country was brought about by the historic, strategic mistakes on the part of the Bolshevik leaders and the CPSU leadership, mistakes committed at different times in state-building and in economic and ethnic policies. The collapse of the historical Russia known as the USSR is on their conscience.

Despite all these injustices, lies and outright pillage of Russia, it was our people who accepted the new geopolitical reality that took shape after the dissolution of the USSR, and recognised the new independent states. Not only did Russia recognise these countries, but helped its CIS partners, even though it faced a very dire situation itself. This included our Ukrainian colleagues, who turned to us for financial support many times from the very moment they declared independence. Our country provided this assistance while respecting Ukraine’s dignity and sovereignty.

According to expert assessments, confirmed by a simple calculation of our energy prices, the subsidised loans Russia provided to Ukraine along with economic and trade preferences, the overall benefit for the Ukrainian budget in the period from 1991 to 2013 amounted to $250 billion.

However, there was more to it than that. By the end of 1991, the USSR owed some $100 billion to other countries and international funds. Initially, there was this idea that all former Soviet republics will pay back these loans together, in the spirit of solidarity and proportionally to their economic potential. However, Russia undertook to pay back all Soviet debts and delivered on this promise by completing this process in 2017.

In exchange for that, the newly independent states had to hand over to Russia part of the Soviet foreign assets. An agreement to this effect was reached with Ukraine in December 1994. However, Kiev failed to ratify these agreements and later simply refused to honour them by making demands for a share of the Diamond Treasury, gold reserves, as well as former USSR property and other assets abroad.

Nevertheless, despite all these challenges, Russia always worked with Ukraine in an open and honest manner and, as I have already said, with respect for its interests. We developed our ties in multiple fields. Thus, in 2011, bilateral trade exceeded $50 billion. Let me note that in 2019, that is before the pandemic, Ukraine’s trade with all EU countries combined was below this indicator.

At the same time, it was striking how the Ukrainian authorities always preferred dealing with Russia in a way that ensured that they enjoy all the rights and privileges while remaining free from any obligations.

The officials in Kiev replaced partnership with a parasitic attitude acting at times in an extremely brash manner. Suffice it to recall the continuous blackmail on energy transits and the fact that they literally stole gas.

I can add that Kiev tried to use dialogue with Russia as a bargaining chip in its relations with the West, using the threat of closer ties with Russia for blackmailing the West to secure preferences by claiming that otherwise Russia would have a bigger influence in Ukraine.

At the same time, the Ukrainian authorities – I would like to emphasise this – began by building their statehood on the negation of everything that united us, trying to distort the mentality and historical memory of millions of people, of entire generations living in Ukraine. It is not surprising that Ukrainian society was faced with the rise of far-right nationalism, which rapidly developed into aggressive Russophobia and neo-Nazism. This resulted in the participation of Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis in the terrorist groups in the North Caucasus and the increasingly loud territorial claims to Russia.

A role in this was played by external forces, which used a ramified network of NGOs and special services to nurture their clients in Ukraine and to bring their representatives to the seats of authority.

It should be noted that Ukraine actually never had stable traditions of real statehood. And, therefore, in 1991 it opted for mindlessly emulating foreign models, which have no relation to history or Ukrainian realities. Political government institutions were readjusted many times to the rapidly growing clans and their self-serving interests, which had nothing to do with the interests of the Ukrainian people.

Essentially, the so-called pro-Western civilisational choice made by the oligarchic Ukrainian authorities was not and is not aimed at creating better conditions in the interests of people’s well-being but at keeping the billions of dollars that the oligarchs have stolen from the Ukrainians and are holding in their accounts in Western banks, while reverently accommodating the geopolitical rivals of Russia.

Some industrial and financial groups and the parties and politicians on their payroll relied on the nationalists and radicals from the very beginning. Others claimed to be in favour of good relations with Russia and cultural and language diversity, coming to power with the help of their citizens who sincerely supported their declared aspirations, including the millions of people in the south-eastern regions. But after getting the positions they coveted, these people immediately betrayed their voters, going back on their election promises and instead steering a policy prompted by the radicals and sometimes even persecuting their former allies – the public organisations that supported bilingualism and cooperation with Russia. These people took advantage of the fact that their voters were mostly law-abiding citizens with moderate views who trusted the authorities, and that, unlike the radicals, they would not act aggressively or make use of illegal instruments.

Meanwhile, the radicals became increasingly brazen in their actions and made more demands every year. They found it easy to force their will on the weak authorities, which were infected with the virus of nationalism and corruption as well and which artfully replaced the real cultural, economic and social interests of the people and Ukraine’s true sovereignty with various ethnic speculations and formal ethnic attributes.

A stable statehood has never developed in Ukraine; its electoral and other political procedures just serve as a cover, a screen for the redistribution of power and property between various oligarchic clans.

Corruption, which is certainly a challenge and a problem for many countries, including Russia, has gone beyond the usual scope in Ukraine. It has literally permeated and corroded Ukrainian statehood, the entire system, and all branches of power.

Radical nationalists took advantage of the justified public discontent and saddled the Maidan protest, escalating it to a coup d'état in 2014. They also had direct assistance from foreign states. According to reports, the US Embassy provided $1 million a day to support the so-called protest camp on Independence Square in Kiev. In addition, large amounts were impudently transferred directly to the opposition leaders’ bank accounts, tens of millions of dollars. But the people who actually suffered, the families of those who died in the clashes provoked in the streets and squares of Kiev and other cities, how much did they get in the end? Better not ask.

The nationalists who have seized power have unleashed a persecution, a real terror campaign against those who opposed their anti-constitutional actions. Politicians, journalists, and public activists were harassed and publicly humiliated. A wave of violence swept Ukrainian cities, including a series of high-profile and unpunished murders. One shudders at the memories of the terrible tragedy in Odessa, where peaceful protesters were brutally murdered, burned alive in the House of Trade Unions. The criminals who committed that atrocity have never been punished, and no one is even looking for them. But we know their names and we will do everything to punish them, find them and bring them to justice.

Maidan did not bring Ukraine any closer to democracy and progress. Having accomplished a coup d'état, the nationalists and those political forces that supported them eventually led Ukraine into an impasse, pushed the country into the abyss of civil war. Eight years later, the country is split. Ukraine is struggling with an acute socioeconomic crisis.

According to international organisations, in 2019, almost 6 million Ukrainians – I emphasise – about 15 percent, not of the wokrforce, but of the entire population of that country, had to go abroad to find work. Most of them do odd jobs. The following fact is also revealing: since 2020, over 60,000 doctors and other health workers have left the country amid the pandemic.

Since 2014, water bills increased by almost a third, and energy bills grew several times, while the price of gas for households surged several dozen times. Many people simply do not have the money to pay for utilities. They literally struggle to survive.

What happened? Why is this all happening? The answer is obvious. They spent and embezzled the legacy inherited not only from the Soviet era, but also from the Russian Empire. They lost tens, hundreds of thousands of jobs which enabled people to earn a reliable income and generate tax revenue, among other things thanks to close cooperation with Russia. Sectors including machine building, instrument engineering, electronics, ship and aircraft building have been undermined or destroyed altogether. There was a time, however, when not only Ukraine, but the entire Soviet Union took pride in these companies.

In 2021, the Black Sea Shipyard in Nikolayev went out of business. Its first docks date back to Catherine the Great. Antonov, the famous manufacturer, has not made a single commercial aircraft since 2016, while Yuzhmash, a factory specialising in missile and space equipment, is nearly bankrupt. The Kremenchug Steel Plant is in a similar situation. This sad list goes on and on.

As for the gas transportation system, it was built in its entirety by the Soviet Union, and it has now deteriorated to an extent that using it creates major risks and comes at a high cost for the environment.

This situation begs the question: poverty, lack of opportunity, and lost industrial and technological potential – is this the pro-Western civilisational choice they have been using for many years to fool millions of people with promises of heavenly pastures?

It all came down to a Ukrainian economy in tatters and an outright pillage of the country’s citizens, while Ukraine itself was placed under external control, directed not only from the Western capitals, but also on the ground, as the saying goes, through an entire network of foreign advisors, NGOs and other institutions present in Ukraine. They have a direct bearing on all the key appointments and dismissals and on all branches of power at all levels, from the central government down to municipalities, as well as on state-owned companies and corporations, including Naftogaz, Ukrenergo, Ukrainian Railways, Ukroboronprom, Ukrposhta, and the Ukrainian Sea Ports Authority.

There is no independent judiciary in Ukraine. The Kiev authorities, at the West’s demand, delegated the priority right to select members of the supreme judicial bodies, the Council of Justice and the High Qualifications Commission of Judges, to international organisations.

In addition, the United States directly controls the National Agency on Corruption Prevention, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau, the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office and the High Anti-Corruption Court. All this is done under the noble pretext of invigorating efforts against corruption. All right, but where are the results? Corruption is flourishing like never before.

Are the Ukrainian people aware that this is how their country is managed? Do they realise that their country has turned not even into a political or economic protectorate but has been reduced to a colony with a puppet regime? The state was privatised. As a result, the government, which designates itself as the “power of patriots” no longer acts in a national capacity and consistently pushes Ukraine towards losing its sovereignty.

The policy to root out the Russian language and culture and promote assimilation carries on. The Verkhovna Rada has generated a steady flow of discriminatory bills, and the law on the so-called indigenous people has already come into force. People who identify as Russians and want to preserve their identity, language and culture are getting the signal that they are not wanted in Ukraine.

Under the laws on education and the Ukrainian language as a state language, the Russian language has no place in schools or public spaces, even in ordinary shops. The law on the so-called vetting of officials and purging their ranks created a pathway for dealing with unwanted civil servants.

There are more and more acts enabling the Ukrainian military and law enforcement agencies to crack down on the freedom of speech, dissent, and going after the opposition. The world knows the deplorable practice of imposing unilateral illegitimate sanctions against other countries, foreign individuals and legal entities. Ukraine has outperformed its Western masters by inventing sanctions against its own citizens, companies, television channels, other media outlets and even members of parliament.

Kiev continues to prepare the destruction of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. This is not an emotional judgement; proof of this can be found in concrete decisions and documents. The Ukrainian authorities have cynically turned the tragedy of the schism into an instrument of state policy. The current authorities do not react to the Ukrainian people’s appeals to abolish the laws that are infringing on believers’ rights. Moreover, new draft laws directed against the clergy and millions of parishioners of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate have been registered in the Verkhovna Rada.

A few words about Crimea. The people of the peninsula freely made their choice to be with Russia. The Kiev authorities cannot challenge the clearly stated choice of the people, which is why they have opted for aggressive action, for activating extremist cells, including radical Islamist organisations, for sending subversives to stage terrorist attacks at critical infrastructure facilities, and for kidnapping Russian citizens. We have factual proof that such aggressive actions are being taken with support from Western security services.

In March 2021, a new Military Strategy was adopted in Ukraine. This document is almost entirely dedicated to confrontation with Russia and sets the goal of involving foreign states in a conflict with our country. The strategy stipulates the organisation of what can be described as a terrorist underground movement in Russia’s Crimea and in Donbass. It also sets out the contours of a potential war, which should end, according to the Kiev strategists, “with the assistance of the international community on favourable terms for Ukraine,” as well as – listen carefully, please – “with foreign military support in the geopolitical confrontation with the Russian Federation.” In fact, this is nothing other than preparation for hostilities against our country, Russia.

As we know, it has already been stated today that Ukraine intends to create its own nuclear weapons, and this is not just bragging. Ukraine has the nuclear technologies created back in the Soviet times and delivery vehicles for such weapons, including aircraft, as well as the Soviet-designed Tochka-U precision tactical missiles with a range of over 100 kilometres. But they can do more; it is only a matter of time. They have had the groundwork for this since the Soviet era.

In other words, acquiring tactical nuclear weapons will be much easier for Ukraine than for some other states I am not going to mention here, which are conducting such research, especially if Kiev receives foreign technological support. We cannot rule this out either.

If Ukraine acquires weapons of mass destruction, the situation in the world and in Europe will drastically change, especially for us, for Russia. We cannot but react to this real danger, all the more so since, let me repeat, Ukraine’s Western patrons may help it acquire these weapons to create yet another threat to our country. We are seeing how persistently the Kiev regime is being pumped with arms. Since 2014, the United States alone has spent billions of dollars for this purpose, including supplies of arms and equipment and training of specialists. In the last few months, there has been a constant flow of Western weapons to Ukraine, ostentatiously, with the entire world watching. Foreign advisors supervise the activities of Ukraine’s armed forces and special services and we are well aware of this.

Over the past few years, military contingents of NATO countries have been almost constantly present on Ukrainian territory under the pretext of exercises. The Ukrainian troop control system has already been integrated into NATO. This means that NATO headquarters can issue direct commands to the Ukrainian armed forces, even to their separate units and squads.

The United States and NATO have started an impudent development of Ukrainian territory as a theatre of potential military operations. Their regular joint exercises are obviously anti-Russian. Last year alone, over 23,000 troops and more than a thousand units of hardware were involved.

A law has already been adopted that allows foreign troops to come to Ukraine in 2022 to take part in multinational drills. Understandably, these are primarily NATO troops. This year, at least ten of these joint drills are planned.

Obviously, such undertakings are designed to be a cover-up for a rapid buildup of the NATO military group on Ukrainian territory. This is all the more so since the network of airfields upgraded with US help in Borispol, Ivano-Frankovsk, Chuguyev and Odessa, to name a few, is capable of transferring army units in a very short time. Ukraine’s airspace is open to flights by US strategic and reconnaissance aircraft and drones that conduct surveillance over Russian territory.

I will add that the US-built Maritime Operations Centre in Ochakov makes it possible to support activity by NATO warships, including the use of precision weapons, against the Russian Black Sea Fleet and our infrastructure on the entire Black Sea Coast.

At one time, the United States intended to build similar facilities in Crimea as well but the Crimeans and residents of Sevastopol wrecked these plans. We will always remember this.

I would like to repeat that today such a centre has already been deployed in Ochakov. In the 18th century, soldiers of Alexander Suvorov fought for this city. Owing to their courage, it became part of Russia. Also in the 18th century, the lands of the Black Sea littoral, incorporated in Russia as a result of wars with the Ottoman Empire, were given the name of Novorossiya (New Russia). Now attempts are being made to condemn these landmarks of history to oblivion, along with the names of state and military figures of the Russian Empire without whose efforts modern Ukraine would not have many big cities or even access to the Black Sea.

A monument to Alexander Suvorov was recently demolished in Poltava. What is there to say? Are you renouncing your own past? The so-called colonial heritage of the Russian Empire? Well, in this case, be consistent.

Next, notably, Article 17 of the Constitution of Ukraine stipulates that deploying foreign military bases on its territory is illegal. However, as it turns out, this is just a conventionality that can be easily circumvented.

Ukraine is home to NATO training missions which are, in fact, foreign military bases. They just called a base a mission and were done with it.

Kiev has long proclaimed a strategic course on joining NATO. Indeed, each country is entitled to pick its own security system and enter into military alliances. There would be no problem with that, if it were not for one “but.” International documents expressly stipulate the principle of equal and indivisible security, which includes obligations not to strengthen one's own security at the expense of the security of other states. This is stated in the 1999 OSCE Charter for European Security adopted in Istanbul and the 2010 OSCE Astana Declaration.

In other words, the choice of pathways towards ensuring security should not pose a threat to other states, whereas Ukraine joining NATO is a direct threat to Russia's security.

Let me remind you that at the Bucharest NATO summit held in April 2008, the United States pushed through a decision to the effect that Ukraine and, by the way, Georgia would become NATO members. Many European allies of the United States were well aware of the risks associated with this prospect already then, but were forced to put up with the will of their senior partner. The Americans simply used them to carry out a clearly anti-Russian policy.

A number of NATO member states are still very sceptical about Ukraine joining NATO. We are getting signals from some European capitals telling us not to worry since it will not happen literally overnight. In fact, our US partners are saying the same thing as well. “All right, then” we respond, “if it does not happen tomorrow, then it will happen the day after tomorrow. What does it change from the historical perspective? Nothing at all.”

Furthermore, we are aware of the US leadership’s position and words that active hostilities in eastern Ukraine do not rule out the possibility of that country joining NATO if it meets NATO criteria and overcomes corruption.

All the while, they are trying to convince us over and over again that NATO is a peace-loving and purely defensive alliance that poses no threat to Russia. Again, they want us to take their word for it. But we are well aware of the real value of these words. In 1990, when German unification was discussed, the United States promised the Soviet leadership that NATO jurisdiction or military presence will not expand one inch to the east and that the unification of Germany will not lead to the spread of NATO's military organisation to the east. This is a quote.

They issued lots of verbal assurances, all of which turned out to be empty phrases. Later, they began to assure us that the accession to NATO by Central and Eastern European countries would only improve relations with Moscow, relieve these countries of the fears steeped in their bitter historical legacy, and even create a belt of countries that are friendly towards Russia.

However, the exact opposite happened. The governments of certain Eastern European countries, speculating on Russophobia, brought their complexes and stereotypes about the Russian threat to the Alliance and insisted on building up the collective defence potentials and deploying them primarily against Russia. Worse still, that happened in the 1990s and the early 2000s when, thanks to our openness and goodwill, relations between Russia and the West had reached a high level.

Russia has fulfilled all of its obligations, including the pullout from Germany, from Central and Eastern Europe, making an immense contribution to overcoming the legacy of the Cold War. We have consistently proposed various cooperation options, including in the NATO-Russia Council and the OSCE formats.

Moreover, I will say something I have never said publicly, I will say it now for the first time. When then outgoing US President Bill Clinton visited Moscow in 2000, I asked him how America would feel about admitting Russia to NATO.

I will not reveal all the details of that conversation, but the reaction to my question was, let us say, quite restrained, and the Americans’ true attitude to that possibility can actually be seen from their subsequent steps with regard to our country. I am referring to the overt support for terrorists in the North Caucasus, the disregard for our security demands and concerns, NATO’s continued expansion, withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, and so on. It raises the question: why? What is all this about, what is the purpose? All right, you do not want to see us as friends or allies, but why make us an enemy?

There can be only one answer – this is not about our political regime or anything like that. They just do not need a big and independent country like Russia around. This is the answer to all questions. This is the source of America’s traditional policy towards Russia. Hence the attitude to all our security proposals

Today, one glance at the map is enough to see to what extent Western countries have kept their promise to refrain from NATO’s eastward expansion. They just cheated. We have seen five waves of NATO expansion, one after another – Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary were admitted in 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004; Albania and Croatia in 2009; Montenegro in 2017; and North Macedonia in 2020.

As a result, the Alliance, its military infrastructure has reached Russia’s borders. This is one of the key causes of the European security crisis; it has had the most negative impact on the entire system of international relations and led to the loss of mutual trust.

The situation continues to deteriorate, including in the strategic area. Thus, positioning areas for interceptor missiles are being established in Romania and Poland as part of the US project to create a global missile defence system. It is common knowledge that the launchers deployed there can be used for Tomahawk cruise missiles – offensive strike systems.

In addition, the United States is developing its all-purpose Standard Missile-6, which can provide air and missile defence, as well as strike ground and surface targets. In other words, the allegedly defensive US missile defence system is developing and expanding its new offensive capabilities.

The information we have gives us good reason to believe that Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the subsequent deployment of NATO facilities has already been decided and is only a matter of time. We clearly understand that given this scenario, the level of military threats to Russia will increase dramatically, several times over. And I would like to emphasise at this point that the risk of a sudden strike at our country will multiply.

I will explain that American strategic planning documents confirm the possibility of a so-called preemptive strike at enemy missile systems. We also know the main adversary of the United States and NATO. It is Russia. NATO documents officially declare our country to be the main threat to Euro-Atlantic security. Ukraine will serve as an advanced bridgehead for such a strike. If our ancestors heard about this, they would probably simply not believe this. We do not want to believe this today either, but it is what it is. I would like people in Russia and Ukraine to understand this.

Many Ukrainian airfields are located not far from our borders. NATO’s tactical aviation deployed there, including precision weapon carriers, will be capable of striking at our territory to the depth of the Volgograd-Kazan-Samara-Astrakhan line. The deployment of reconnaissance radars on Ukrainian territory will allow NATO to tightly control Russia’s airspace up to the Urals.

Finally, after the US destroyed the INF Treaty, the Pentagon has been openly developing many land-based attack weapons, including ballistic missiles that are capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 5,500 km. If deployed in Ukraine, such systems will be able to hit targets in Russia’s entire European part. The flying time of Tomahawk cruise missiles to Moscow will be less than 35 minutes; ballistic missiles from Kharkov will take seven to eight minutes; and hypersonic assault weapons, four to five minutes. It is like a knife to the throat. I have no doubt that they hope to carry out these plans, as they did many times in the past, expanding NATO eastward, moving their military infrastructure to Russian borders and fully ignoring our concerns, protests and warnings. Excuse me, but they simply did not care at all about such things and did whatever they deemed necessary.

Of course, they are going to behave in the same way in the future, following a well-known proverb: “The dogs bark but the caravan goes on.” Let me say right away – we do not accept this behaviour and will never accept it. That said, Russia has always advocated the resolution of the most complicated problems by political and diplomatic means, at the negotiating table.

We are well aware of our enormous responsibility when it comes to regional and global stability. Back in 2008, Russia put forth an initiative to conclude a European Security Treaty under which not a single Euro-Atlantic state or international organisation could strengthen their security at the expense of the security of others. However, our proposal was rejected right off the bat on the pretext that Russia should not be allowed to put limits on NATO activities.

Furthermore, it was made explicitly clear to us that only NATO members can have legally binding security guarantees.

Last December, we handed over to our Western partners a draft treaty between the Russian Federation and the United States of America on security guarantees, as well as a draft agreement on measures to ensure the security of the Russian Federation and NATO member states.

The United States and NATO responded with general statements. There were kernels of rationality in them as well, but they concerned matters of secondary importance and it all looked like an attempt to drag the issue out and to lead the discussion astray.

We responded to this accordingly and pointed out that we were ready to follow the path of negotiations, provided, however, that all issues are considered as a package that includes Russia’s core proposals which contain three key points. First, to prevent further NATO expansion. Second, to have the Alliance refrain from deploying assault weapon systems on Russian borders. And finally, rolling back the bloc's military capability and infrastructure in Europe to where they were in 1997, when the NATO-Russia Founding Act was signed.

These principled proposals of ours have been ignored. To reiterate, our Western partners have once again vocalised the all-too-familiar formulas that each state is entitled to freely choose ways to ensure its security or to join any military union or alliance. That is, nothing has changed in their stance, and we keep hearing the same old references to NATO’s notorious “open door” policy. Moreover, they are again trying to blackmail us and are threatening us with sanctions, which, by the way, they will introduce no matter what as Russia continues to strengthen its sovereignty and its Armed Forces. To be sure, they will never think twice before coming up with or just fabricating a pretext for yet another sanction attack regardless of the developments in Ukraine. Their one and only goal is to hold back the development of Russia. And they will keep doing so, just as they did before, even without any formal pretext just because we exist and will never compromise our sovereignty, national interests or values.

I would like to be clear and straightforward: in the current circumstances, when our proposals for an equal dialogue on fundamental issues have actually remained unanswered by the United States and NATO, when the level of threats to our country has increased significantly, Russia has every right to respond in order to ensure its security. That is exactly what we will do.

With regard to the state of affairs in Donbass, we see that the ruling Kiev elites never stop publicly making clear their unwillingness to comply with the Minsk Package of Measures to settle the conflict and are not interested in a peaceful settlement. On the contrary, they are trying to orchestrate a blitzkrieg in Donbass as was the case in 2014 and 2015. We all know how these reckless schemes ended.

Not a single day goes by without Donbass communities coming under shelling attacks. The recently formed large military force makes use of attack drones, heavy equipment, missiles, artillery and multiple rocket launchers. The killing of civilians, the blockade, the abuse of people, including children, women and the elderly, continues unabated. As we say, there is no end in sight to this.

Meanwhile, the so-called civilised world, which our Western colleagues proclaimed themselves the only representatives of, prefers not to see this, as if this horror and genocide, which almost 4 million people are facing, do not exist. But they do exist and only because these people did not agree with the West-supported coup in Ukraine in 2014 and opposed the transition towards the Neanderthal and aggressive nationalism and neo-Nazism which have been elevated in Ukraine to the rank of national policy. They are fighting for their elementary right to live on their own land, to speak their own language, and to preserve their culture and traditions.

How long can this tragedy continue? How much longer can one put up with this? Russia has done everything to preserve Ukraine’s territorial integrity. All these years, it has persistently and patiently pushed for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 2202 of February 17, 2015, which consolidated the Minsk Package of Measures of February 12, 2015, to settle the situation in Donbass.

Everything was in vain. Presidents and Rada deputies come and go, but deep down the aggressive and nationalistic regime that seized power in Kiev remains unchanged. It is entirely a product of the 2014 coup, and those who then embarked on the path of violence, bloodshed and lawlessness did not recognise then and do not recognise now any solution to the Donbass issue other than a military one.

In this regard, I consider it necessary to take a long overdue decision and to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Lugansk People's Republic.

I would like to ask the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation to support this decision and then ratify the Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance with both republics. These two documents will be prepared and signed shortly.

We want those who seized and continue to hold power in Kiev to immediately stop hostilities. Otherwise, the responsibility for the possible continuation of the bloodshed will lie entirely on the conscience of Ukraine’s ruling regime.

As I announce the decisions taken today, I remain confident in the support of Russia’s citizens and the country’s patriotic forces.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Citizens of Russia, friends,

I consider it necessary today to speak again about the tragic events in Donbass and the key aspects of ensuring the security of Russia.

I will begin with what I said in my address on February 21, 2022. I spoke about our biggest concerns and worries, and about the fundamental threats which irresponsible Western politicians created for Russia consistently, rudely and unceremoniously from year to year. I am referring to the eastward expansion of NATO, which is moving its military infrastructure ever closer to the Russian border.

It is a fact that over the past 30 years we have been patiently trying to come to an agreement with the leading NATO countries regarding the principles of equal and indivisible security in Europe. In response to our proposals, we invariably faced either cynical deception and lies or attempts at pressure and blackmail, while the North Atlantic alliance continued to expand despite our protests and concerns. Its military machine is moving and, as I said, is approaching our very border.

Why is this happening? Where did this insolent manner of talking down from the height of their exceptionalism, infallibility and all-permissiveness come from? What is the explanation for this contemptuous and disdainful attitude to our interests and absolutely legitimate demands?

The answer is simple. Everything is clear and obvious. In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union grew weaker and subsequently broke apart. That experience should serve as a good lesson for us, because it has shown us that the paralysis of power and will is the first step towards complete degradation and oblivion. We lost confidence for only one moment, but it was enough to disrupt the balance of forces in the world.

As a result, the old treaties and agreements are no longer effective. Entreaties and requests do not help. Anything that does not suit the dominant state, the powers that be, is denounced as archaic, obsolete and useless. At the same time, everything it regards as useful is presented as the ultimate truth and forced on others regardless of the cost, abusively and by any means available. Those who refuse to comply are subjected to strong-arm tactics.

What I am saying now does not concerns only Russia, and Russia is not the only country that is worried about this. This has to do with the entire system of international relations, and sometimes even US allies. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to a redivision of the world, and the norms of international law that developed by that time – and the most important of them, the fundamental norms that were adopted following WWII and largely formalised its outcome – came in the way of those who declared themselves the winners of the Cold War.

Of course, practice, international relations and the rules regulating them had to take into account the changes that took place in the world and in the balance of forces. However, this should have been done professionally, smoothly, patiently, and with due regard and respect for the interests of all states and one’s own responsibility. Instead, we saw a state of euphoria created by the feeling of absolute superiority, a kind of modern absolutism, coupled with the low cultural standards and arrogance of those who formulated and pushed through decisions that suited only themselves. The situation took a different turn.

There are many examples of this. First a bloody military operation was waged against Belgrade, without the UN Security Council’s sanction but with combat aircraft and missiles used in the heart of Europe. The bombing of peaceful cities and vital infrastructure went on for several weeks. I have to recall these facts, because some Western colleagues prefer to forget them, and when we mentioned the event, they prefer to avoid speaking about international law, instead emphasising the circumstances which they interpret as they think necessary.

Then came the turn of Iraq, Libya and Syria. The illegal use of military power against Libya and the distortion of all the UN Security Council decisions on Libya ruined the state, created a huge seat of international terrorism, and pushed the country towards a humanitarian catastrophe, into the vortex of a civil war, which has continued there for years. The tragedy, which was created for hundreds of thousands and even millions of people not only in Libya but in the whole region, has led to a large-scale exodus from the Middle East and North Africa to Europe.

A similar fate was also prepared for Syria. The combat operations conducted by the Western coalition in that country without the Syrian government’s approval or UN Security Council’s sanction can only be defined as aggression and intervention.

But the example that stands apart from the above events is, of course, the invasion of Iraq without any legal grounds. They used the pretext of allegedly reliable information available in the United States about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. To prove that allegation, the US Secretary of State held up a vial with white power, publicly, for the whole world to see, assuring the international community that it was a chemical warfare agent created in Iraq. It later turned out that all of that was a fake and a sham, and that Iraq did not have any chemical weapons. Incredible and shocking but true. We witnessed lies made at the highest state level and voiced from the high UN rostrum. As a result we see a tremendous loss in human life, damage, destruction, and a colossal upsurge of terrorism.

Overall, it appears that nearly everywhere, in many regions of the world where the United States brought its law and order, this created bloody, non-healing wounds and the curse of international terrorism and extremism. I have only mentioned the most glaring but far from only examples of disregard for international law.

This array includes promises not to expand NATO eastwards even by an inch. To reiterate: they have deceived us, or, to put it simply, they have played us. Sure, one often hears that politics is a dirty business. It could be, but it shouldn’t be as dirty as it is now, not to such an extent. This type of con-artist behaviour is contrary not only to the principles of international relations but also and above all to the generally accepted norms of morality and ethics. Where is justice and truth here? Just lies and hypocrisy all around.

Incidentally, US politicians, political scientists and journalists write and say that a veritable “empire of lies” has been created inside the United States in recent years. It is hard to disagree with this – it is really so. But one should not be modest about it: the United States is still a great country and a system-forming power. All its satellites not only humbly and obediently say yes to and parrot it at the slightest pretext but also imitate its behaviour and enthusiastically accept the rules it is offering them. Therefore, one can say with good reason and confidence that the whole so-called Western bloc formed by the United States in its own image and likeness is, in its entirety, the very same “empire of lies.”

As for our country, after the disintegration of the USSR, given the entire unprecedented openness of the new, modern Russia, its readiness to work honestly with the United States and other Western partners, and its practically unilateral disarmament, they immediately tried to put the final squeeze on us, finish us off, and utterly destroy us. This is how it was in the 1990s and the early 2000s, when the so-called collective West was actively supporting separatism and gangs of mercenaries in southern Russia. What victims, what losses we had to sustain and what trials we had to go through at that time before we broke the back of international terrorism in the Caucasus! We remember this and will never forget.

Properly speaking, the attempts to use us in their own interests never ceased until quite recently: they sought to destroy our traditional values and force on us their false values that would erode us, our people from within, the attitudes they have been aggressively imposing on their countries, attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature. This is not going to happen. No one has ever succeeded in doing this, nor will they succeed now.

Despite all that, in December 2021, we made yet another attempt to reach agreement with the United States and its allies on the principles of European security and NATO’s non-expansion. Our efforts were in vain. The United States has not changed its position. It does not believe it necessary to agree with Russia on a matter that is critical for us. The United States is pursuing its own objectives, while neglecting our interests.

Of course, this situation begs a question: what next, what are we to expect? If history is any guide, we know that in 1940 and early 1941 the Soviet Union went to great lengths to prevent war or at least delay its outbreak. To this end, the USSR sought not to provoke the potential aggressor until the very end by refraining or postponing the most urgent and obvious preparations it had to make to defend itself from an imminent attack. When it finally acted, it was too late.

As a result, the country was not prepared to counter the invasion by Nazi Germany, which attacked our Motherland on June 22, 1941, without declaring war. The country stopped the enemy and went on to defeat it, but this came at a tremendous cost. The attempt to appease the aggressor ahead of the Great Patriotic War proved to be a mistake which came at a high cost for our people. In the first months after the hostilities broke out, we lost vast territories of strategic importance, as well as millions of lives. We will not make this mistake the second time. We have no right to do so.

Those who aspire to global dominance have publicly designated Russia as their enemy. They did so with impunity. Make no mistake, they had no reason to act this way. It is true that they have considerable financial, scientific, technological, and military capabilities. We are aware of this and have an objective view of the economic threats we have been hearing, just as our ability to counter this brash and never-ending blackmail. Let me reiterate that we have no illusions in this regard and are extremely realistic in our assessments.

As for military affairs, even after the dissolution of the USSR and losing a considerable part of its capabilities, today’s Russia remains one of the most powerful nuclear states. Moreover, it has a certain advantage in several cutting-edge weapons. In this context, there should be no doubt for anyone that any potential aggressor will face defeat and ominous consequences should it directly attack our country.

At the same time, technology, including in the defence sector, is changing rapidly. One day there is one leader, and tomorrow another, but a military presence in territories bordering on Russia, if we permit it to go ahead, will stay for decades to come or maybe forever, creating an ever mounting and totally unacceptable threat for Russia.

Even now, with NATO’s eastward expansion the situation for Russia has been becoming worse and more dangerous by the year. Moreover, these past days NATO leadership has been blunt in its statements that they need to accelerate and step up efforts to bring the alliance’s infrastructure closer to Russia’s borders. In other words, they have been toughening their position. We cannot stay idle and passively observe these developments. This would be an absolutely irresponsible thing to do for us.

Any further expansion of the North Atlantic alliance’s infrastructure or the ongoing efforts to gain a military foothold of the Ukrainian territory are unacceptable for us. Of course, the question is not about NATO itself. It merely serves as a tool of US foreign policy. The problem is that in territories adjacent to Russia, which I have to note is our historical land, a hostile “anti-Russia” is taking shape. Fully controlled from the outside, it is doing everything to attract NATO armed forces and obtain cutting-edge weapons.

For the United States and its allies, it is a policy of containing Russia, with obvious geopolitical dividends. For our country, it is a matter of life and death, a matter of our historical future as a nation. This is not an exaggeration; this is a fact. It is not only a very real threat to our interests but to the very existence of our state and to its sovereignty. It is the red line which we have spoken about on numerous occasions. They have crossed it.

This brings me to the situation in Donbass. We can see that the forces that staged the coup in Ukraine in 2014 have seized power, are keeping it with the help of ornamental election procedures and have abandoned the path of a peaceful conflict settlement. For eight years, for eight endless years we have been doing everything possible to settle the situation by peaceful political means. Everything was in vain.

As I said in my previous address, you cannot look without compassion at what is happening there. It became impossible to tolerate it. We had to stop that atrocity, that genocide of the millions of people who live there and who pinned their hopes on Russia, on all of us. It is their aspirations, the feelings and pain of these people that were the main motivating force behind our decision to recognise the independence of the Donbass people’s republics.

I would like to additionally emphasise the following. Focused on their own goals, the leading NATO countries are supporting the far-right nationalists and neo-Nazis in Ukraine, those who will never forgive the people of Crimea and Sevastopol for freely making a choice to reunite with Russia.

They will undoubtedly try to bring war to Crimea just as they have done in Donbass, to kill innocent people just as members of the punitive units of Ukrainian nationalists and Hitler’s accomplices did during the Great Patriotic War. They have also openly laid claim to several other Russian regions.

If we look at the sequence of events and the incoming reports, the showdown between Russia and these forces cannot be avoided. It is only a matter of time. They are getting ready and waiting for the right moment. Moreover, they went as far as aspire to acquire nuclear weapons. We will not let this happen.

I have already said that Russia accepted the new geopolitical reality after the dissolution of the USSR. We have been treating all new post-Soviet states with respect and will continue to act this way. We respect and will respect their sovereignty, as proven by the assistance we provided to Kazakhstan when it faced tragic events and a challenge in terms of its statehood and integrity. However, Russia cannot feel safe, develop, and exist while facing a permanent threat from the territory of today’s Ukraine.

Let me remind you that in 2000–2005 we used our military to push back against terrorists in the Caucasus and stood up for the integrity of our state. We preserved Russia. In 2014, we supported the people of Crimea and Sevastopol. In 2015, we used our Armed Forces to create a reliable shield that prevented terrorists from Syria from penetrating Russia. This was a matter of defending ourselves. We had no other choice.

The same is happening today. They did not leave us any other option for defending Russia and our people, other than the one we are forced to use today. In these circumstances, we have to take bold and immediate action. The people’s republics of Donbass have asked Russia for help.

In this context, in accordance with Article 51 (Chapter VII) of the UN Charter, with permission of Russia’s Federation Council, and in execution of the treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Lugansk People’s Republic, ratified by the Federal Assembly on February 22, I made a decision to carry out a special military operation.

The purpose of this operation is to protect people who, for eight years now, have been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kiev regime. To this end, we will seek to demilitarise and denazify Ukraine, as well as bring to trial those who perpetrated numerous bloody crimes against civilians, including against citizens of the Russian Federation.

It is not our plan to occupy the Ukrainian territory. We do not intend to impose anything on anyone by force. At the same time, we have been hearing an increasing number of statements coming from the West that there is no need any more to abide by the documents setting forth the outcomes of World War II, as signed by the totalitarian Soviet regime. How can we respond to that?

The outcomes of World War II and the sacrifices our people had to make to defeat Nazism are sacred. This does not contradict the high values of human rights and freedoms in the reality that emerged over the post-war decades. This does not mean that nations cannot enjoy the right to self-determination, which is enshrined in Article 1 of the UN Charter.

Let me remind you that the people living in territories which are part of today’s Ukraine were not asked how they want to build their lives when the USSR was created or after World War II. Freedom guides our policy, the freedom to choose independently our future and the future of our children. We believe that all the peoples living in today’s Ukraine, anyone who want to do this, must be able to enjoy this right to make a free choice.

In this context I would like to address the citizens of Ukraine. In 2014, Russia was obliged to protect the people of Crimea and Sevastopol from those who you yourself call “nats.” The people of Crimea and Sevastopol made their choice in favour of being with their historical homeland, Russia, and we supported their choice. As I said, we could not act otherwise.

The current events have nothing to do with a desire to infringe on the interests of Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. They are connected with the defending Russia from those who have taken Ukraine hostage and are trying to use it against our country and our people.

I reiterate: we are acting to defend ourselves from the threats created for us and from a worse peril than what is happening now. I am asking you, however hard this may be, to understand this and to work together with us so as to turn this tragic page as soon as possible and to move forward together, without allowing anyone to interfere in our affairs and our relations but developing them independently, so as to create favourable conditions for overcoming all these problems and to strengthen us from within as a single whole, despite the existence of state borders. I believe in this, in our common future.

I would also like to address the military personnel of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Comrade officers,

Your fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers did not fight the Nazi occupiers and did not defend our common Motherland to allow today’s neo-Nazis to seize power in Ukraine. You swore the oath of allegiance to the Ukrainian people and not to the junta, the people’s adversary which is plundering Ukraine and humiliating the Ukrainian people.

I urge you to refuse to carry out their criminal orders. I urge you to immediately lay down arms and go home. I will explain what this means: the military personnel of the Ukrainian army who do this will be able to freely leave the zone of hostilities and return to their families.

I want to emphasise again that all responsibility for the possible bloodshed will lie fully and wholly with the ruling Ukrainian regime.

I would now like to say something very important for those who may be tempted to interfere in these developments from the outside. No matter who tries to stand in our way or all the more so create threats for our country and our people, they must know that Russia will respond immediately, and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history. No matter how the events unfold, we are ready. All the necessary decisions in this regard have been taken. I hope that my words will be heard.

Citizens of Russia,

The culture and values, experience and traditions of our ancestors invariably provided a powerful underpinning for the wellbeing and the very existence of entire states and nations, their success and viability. Of course, this directly depends on the ability to quickly adapt to constant change, maintain social cohesion, and readiness to consolidate and summon all the available forces in order to move forward.

We always need to be strong, but this strength can take on different forms. The “empire of lies,” which I mentioned in the beginning of my speech, proceeds in its policy primarily from rough, direct force. This is when our saying on being “all brawn and no brains” applies.

We all know that having justice and truth on our side is what makes us truly strong. If this is the case, it would be hard to disagree with the fact that it is our strength and our readiness to fight that are the bedrock of independence and sovereignty and provide the necessary foundation for building a reliable future for your home, your family, and your Motherland.

Dear compatriots,

I am certain that devoted soldiers and officers of Russia’s Armed Forces will perform their duty with professionalism and courage. I have no doubt that the government institutions at all levels and specialists will work effectively to guarantee the stability of our economy, financial system and social wellbeing, and the same applies to corporate executives and the entire business community. I hope that all parliamentary parties and civil society take a consolidated, patriotic position.

At the end of the day, the future of Russia is in the hands of its multi-ethnic people, as has always been the case in our history. This means that the decisions that I made will be executed, that we will achieve the goals we have set, and reliably guarantee the security of our Motherland.

I believe in your support and the invincible force rooted in the love for our Fatherland.","Washington was pursuing a “policy of containing Russia, with obvious geopolitical dividends,” Putin

“not only a very real threat” to Russia’s interests but to “the very existence” of the state and to its

threats for our country and our people,” had to know that “Russia will respond immediately, and the

BRIEFING ROOM
SPEECHES AND REMARKS
East Room

1:43 P.M. EST

THE PRESIDENT:  Sorry to keep you waiting.  Good afternoon.  The Russian military has begun a brutal assault on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity.

This is a premeditated attack.  Vladimir Putin has been planning this for months, as I’ve been — as we’ve been saying all along.  He moved more than 175,000 troops, military equipment into positions along the Ukrainian border.

He moved blood supplies into position and built a field hospital, which tells you all you need to know about his intentions all along.

He rejected every good-faith effort the United States and our Allies and partners made to address our mutual security concerns through dialogue to avoid needless conflict and avert human suffering.

For weeks — for weeks, we have been warning that this would happen.  And now it’s unfolding largely as we predicted.

In the past week, we’ve seen shelling increase in the Donbas, the region in eastern Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed separatists.

Rus- — the Russian government has perpetrated cyberattacks against Ukraine.

We saw a staged political theater in Moscow — outlandish and baseless claims that Ukraine was — Ukraine was about to invade and launch a war against Russia, that Ukraine was prepared to use chemical weapons, that Ukraine committed a genocide — without any evidence.

We saw a flagrant violation of international law in attempting to unilaterally create two new so-called republics on sovereign Ukrainian territory.

And at the very moment that the United Nations Security Council was meeting to stand up for Ukraine’s sovereignty to stave off invasion, Putin declared his war.

Within moments — moments, missile strikes began to fall on historic cities across Ukraine.

Then came in the air raids, followed by tanks and troops rolling in.

We’ve been transparent with the world.  We’ve shared declassified evidence about Russia’s plans and cyberattacks and false pretexts so that there can be no confusion or cover-up about what Putin was doing.

Putin is the aggressor.  Putin chose this war.  And now he and his country will bear the consequences.

Today, I’m authorizing additional strong sanctions and new limitations on what can be exported to Russia.

This is going to impose severe costs on the Russian economy, both immediately and over time.

We have purposefully designed these sanctions to maximize the long-term impact on Russia and to minimize the impact on the United States and our Allies. 

And I want to be clear: The United States is not doing this alone.  For months, we’ve been building a coalition of partners representing well more than half of the global economy.

Twenty-seven members of the European Union, including France, Germany, Italy — as well as the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and many others — to amplify the joint impact of our response.

I just spoke with the G7 leaders this morning, and we are in full and total agreement.  We will limit Russia’s ability to do business in Dollars, Euros, Pounds, and Yen to be part of the global economy.  We will limit their ability to do that.  We are going to stunt the ability to finance and grow Rus- — the Russian military.

We’re going to impose major — and we’re going to impair their ability to compete in a high-tech 21st century economy.

We’ve already seen the impact of our actions on Russia’s currency, the Ruble, which early today hit its weakest level ever — ever in history.  And the Russian stock market plunged today.  The Russian government’s borrowing rate spiked by over 15 percent.

In today’s actions, we have now sanctioned Russian banks that together hold around $1 trillion in assets.

We’ve cut off Russia’s largest bank — a bank that holds more than one third of Russia’s banking assets by itself — cut it off from the U.S. financial system. 

And today, we’re also blocking four more major banks.  That means every asset they have in America will be frozen.  This includes V.T.B., the second-largest bank in Russia, which has $250 billion in assets.

As promised, we’re also adding names to the list of Russian elites and their family members that are sanctioning — that we’re sanctioning as well.

As I said on Tuesday, these are people who personally gain from the Kremlin’s policies and they should share in the pain.  We will keep up this drumbeat of those designations against corrupt billionaires in the days ahead.

On Tuesday, we stopped the Russian government from raising money from U.S. or European investors.

Now, we’re going to apply the same restrictions to Russia’s largest state-owned enterprises — companies with assets that exceed $1.4 trillion.

Some of the most powerful impacts of our actions will come over time as we squeeze Russia’s access to finance and technology for strategic sectors of its economy and degrade its industrial capacity for years to come.

Between our actions and those of our Allies and partners, we estimate that we’ll cut off more than half of Russia’s high-tech imports.

It will strike a blow to their ability to continue to modernize their military.  It’ll degrade their aerospace industry, including their space program.  It will hurt their ability to build ships, reducing their ability to compete economically.  And it will be a major hit to Putin’s long-term strategic ambitions. 

And we’re preparing to do more.  In addition to the economic penalties we’re imposing, we’re also taking steps to defend our NATO Allies, particularly in the east.

Tomorrow, NATO will convene a summit — we’ll be there — to bring together the leaders of 30 Allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO Alliance.

Although we provided over $650 million in defensive assistance to Ukraine just this year — this last year, let me say it again: Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine.  Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies and reassure those Allies in the east.

As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power.  And the good news is: NATO is more united and more determined than ever.

There is no doubt — no doubt that the United States and every NATO Ally will meet our Article 5 commitments, which says that an attack on one is an attack on all.

Over the past few weeks, I ordered thousands of additional forces to Germany and Poland as part of our commitment to NATO.

On Tuesday, in response to Russia’s aggressive action, including its troop presence in Belarus and the Black Sea, I’ve authorized the deployment of ground and air forces already stationed in Europe to NATO’s eastern flank Allies: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania.

Our Allies have also been stepping up, adding — the other Allies, the rest of NATO — adding their own forces and capabilities to ensure our collective defense.

And today, within hours of Russia’s unleashing its assault, NATO came together and authorized and activated — an activation of response plans.

This will enable NATO’s high-readiness forces to deploy and — when and where they’re needed to protect our NATO Allies on the eastern boundaries of Europe.

And now I’m authorizing additional U.S. forces and capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO’s response, including some of U.S.-based forces that the Department of Defense placed on standby weeks ago.

I’ve also spoken with Defense Secretary Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, about preparations for additional moves should they become necessary to protect our NATO Allies and support the greatest military Alliance in the history of the world — NATO.

As we respond, my administration is using the tools — every tool at our disposal to protect American families and businesses from rising prices at the gas pump.

You know, we’re taking active steps to bring down the costs.  And American oil and gas companies should not — should not exploit this moment to hike their prices to raise profits.

You know, in our sanctions package, we specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue.

We are closely monitoring energy supplies for any disruption.  We have been coordinating with major oil producing and consuming countries toward our common interest to secure global energy supplies.

We are actively working with countries around the world to elevate [evaluate] a collective release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserves of major energy-consuming countries.  And the United States will release additional barrels of oil as conditions warrant.

I know this is hard and that Americans are already hurting.  I will do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump.  This is critical to me.

But this aggression cannot go unanswered.  If it did, the consequences for America would be much worse.  America stands up to bullies.  We stand up for freedom.  This is who we are.

Let me also repeat the warning I made last week: If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond.

For months, we have been working closely with our private — with the private sector to harden their cyber defenses, sharpen our ability to respond to Russian cyberattacks as well.

I spoke late last night to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I assured him that the United States, together with our Allies and partners in Europe, will support the Ukrainian people as they defend their country.  We’ll provide humanitarian relief to ease their suffering.

And in the early days of this conflict, Russian propaganda outlets will keep trying to hide the truth and claim success for its military operation against a made-up threat.

But history has shown time and again how swift gains in territory eventually give way to grinding occupations, acts of mass civil — mass civil disobedience, and strategic dead-ends.

The next few weeks and months will be hard on the people of Ukraine.  Putin has unleashed a great pain on them.  But the Ukrainian people have known 30 years of independence, and they have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.

This is a dangerous moment for all of Europe, for the freedom around the world.  Putin has a — has committed an assault on the very principles that uphold global peace.

But now the entire world sees clearly what Putin and his Kremlin — and his Kremlin allies are really all about.  This was never about genuine security concerns on their part.  It was always about naked aggression, about Putin’s desire for empire by any means necessary — by bullying Russia’s neighbors through coercion and corruption, by changing borders by force, and, ultimately, by choosing a war without a cause.

Putin’s actions betray his sinister vision for the future of our world — one where nations take what they want by force.

But it is a vision that the United States and freedom-loving nations everywhere will oppose with every tool of our considerable power.

The United States and our Allies and partners will emerge from this stronger, more united, more determined, and more purposeful.

And Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly — economically and strategically.  We will make sure of that.  Putin will be a pariah on the international stage.  Any nation that countenances Russia’s naked aggression against Ukraine will be stained by association.

When the history of this era is written, Putin’s choice to make a totally unjustifiable war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.

Liberty, democracy, human dignity — these are the forces far more powerful than fear and oppression.  They cannot be extinguished by tyrants like Putin and his armies.  They cannot be erased by people — from people’s hearts and hopes by any amount of violence and intimidation.  They endure. 

And in the contest between democracy and autocracy, between sovereignty and subjugation, make no mistake: Freedom will prevail.

God bless the people of a free and democratic Ukraine.  And may God protect our troops.

Q    President Biden —

THE PRESIDENT:  Associated Press, Zeke.

Q    Chris Megerian.  So, do you have any plans to speak with President Putin at this point?  And what interactions have you had with the Russian government?

THE PRESIDENT:  I heard the first part: Do I have any plans to speak with Putin at this point.  And what?

Q    What communications have you had with the Kremlin as far as military (inaudible) in Ukraine and making sure this does not spiral into a larger conflict?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, it’s a large conflict already.  The way we’re going to assure it’s not going to spiral to a larger conflict is by providing all the forces needed in the Eastern European nations that are members of NATO.  NATO is more united than it’s ever been. 

And I have no plans to talk with Putin. 

Wall Street Journal, Tarina [Tarini].

Q    Mr. President, you didn’t mention SWIFT in your sanctions that you announced.  Is there a reason why the U.S. isn’t doing that?  Is there disagreement among Allies regarding SWIFT and whether Russia should be allowed to be a part of it?

THE PRESIDENT:  The sanctions that we have proposed on all their banks is of equal consequence — maybe more consequence than SWIFT — number one. 

Number two, it is always an option.  But right now, that’s not the position that the rest of Europe wishes to take. 

Cecilia Ve- — Vega, ABC. 

Q    Thank you, sir.  Sir, sanctions clearly have not been enough to deter Vladimir Putin to this point.  What is going to stop him?  How and when does this end?  And do you see him trying to go beyond Ukraine?

And a second question I’ll just give to you now: This statement that he gave last night will — that the We- — the threat that he gave — the West “will face consequences greater than any you have faced in history.”  Is he threatening a nuclear strike?

THE PRESIDENT:  I have no idea what he’s threatening.  I know what he has done, number one. 

And number two, no one expected the sanctions to prevent anything from happening.  That has to sh- — this is going to take time.  And we have to show resolve so he knows what’s coming and so the people of Russia know what he’s brought on them.  That’s what this is all about. 

This is going to take time.  It’s not going to occur — he’s going to say, “Oh my God, these sanctions are coming.  I’m going to stand down.” 

He’s going to test the resolve of the West to see if we stay together.  And we will.  We will and it will impose significant costs on him. 

Q    Will he go beyond Ukraine, sir?  Do you see him going beyond Ukraine?

Q    Mr. President — Mr. President —

THE PRESIDENT:  (Points to reporter.)  Yes.

Q    Thank you.  Two topics, just really quick.  First, markets are down and gas prices are up.  I know you always stress the difference between Wall Street and Main Street, but everybody seems to be in for some economic pain.  How economically painful is it going to get for people in this country?

And I do have one more question. 

THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, there’s no doubt that when a major nuclear power attacks and invades another country that the world is going to respond and markets are going to respond all over the world.  So, there’s no doubt about that, number one.

Number two, the notion that this is going to last for a long time is highly unlikely, as long as we continue to stay resolved in imposing the sanctions we’re going to impose on Russia, period. 

What’s your next question?  I’m sorry.

Q    The next question is: Did you underestimate Putin?  And would you still describe him the way that you did in the summer, as a “worthy adversary”?

THE PRESIDENT:  At the time, he was — I made it clear he was an adversary, and I said he was “worthy.”  I didn’t underestimate him. 

And I’ve read most of everything he’s written.  Did you read the — I shouldn’t sa- — I’m not being a wise guy.  The — you heard the speech he made — almost an hour’s worth of speeches — why he was going into Ukraine. 

He has much larger ambitions in Ukraine.  He wants to, in fact, reestablish the former Soviet Union.  That’s what this is about. 

And I think that his — his ambitions are — are completely contrary to the place where the rest of the world has arrived.

Q    President Biden — President Biden —

Q    And — and with that — with his ambitions, you’re confident that these devastating sanctions are going to be as devastating as Russian missiles and bullets and tanks?

THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Russian bullets, missiles, and tanks in Ukraine.  Yes, I am.

Q    Thank you, President Biden.  If sanctions cannot stop President Putin, what penalty can?

     THE PRESIDENT:  I didn’t say sanctions couldn’t stop him.

Q    But you’ve been talking about the threat of these sanctions for several weeks now —

     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but the threat of the sanctions and imposing the sanctions and seeing the effect of the sanctions are two different things.

     Q    Okay, but —

     THE PRESIDENT:  They’re two different things.  And we’re now going to — he’s going to begin to see the effect of the sanctions.

Q    And what will that do — how will that change his mindset here, given he’s attacking Ukraine as we speak?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Because it will so weaken his country that he’ll have to make a very, very difficult choices of whether to continue to move toward being a second-rate power or, in fact, respond.

     Q    You said, in recent weeks, that big nations cannot bluff when it comes to something like this.  You recently said that the idea of personally sanctioning President Putin was on the table.  Is that a step that you’re prepared to take?  And if not —

     THE PRESIDENT:  It’s not a bluff; it’s on the table.

     Q    Sanctioning President Putin?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.

     Q    Why not sanction him today, sir?  Why not sanction him today, sir?

Q    Mr. President —

     Q    Mr. President, if I can, you detailed some severe and swift new sanctions today and said the impact it will have over time, but given the full-scale invasion, given that you’re not pursuing disconnecting Russia from what’s called “SWIFT” — the international banking system — or other sanctions at your disposal, respectfully, sir, what more are you waiting for?

THE PRESIDENT:  Specifically, the sanctions we’ve imposed exceed SWIFT.  The sanctions we imposed exceed anything that’s ever been done.  The sanctions we imposed have generated two thirds of the world joining us.  They are profound sanctions.  Let’s have a conversation in another month or so to see if they’re working.

     Yes.

     Q    Let me ask you about — can I ask you about Zelenskyy?  Sir, you spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday, sir, if I could follow up —

Q    What’s the risk that we are watching the beginning of another Cold War?  And is there now a complete rupture in U.S. and Russian relations?

THE PRESIDENT:  There is a complete rupture right now in U.S.-Russian relations if they continue on this path that they’re on.

     And in terms of a Cold War, that depends.  You have the vast majority of the rest of the world in total opposition to what he’s doing — from Asia to South America to Europe to acr- — around the world. 

And so, it’s going to be a cold day for Russia.  The idea — you don’t see a whole lot of people coming to his defense.

Q    And are you — are you — if I could follow-up, sir. Are you urging China to help isolate Russia?  Are you urging China to help isolate Russia?

THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not prepared to comment on that at the moment.

     (Cross-talk by reporters.)

Q    Mr. President —

     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  No, no.  (Points to reporter.)  Yeah.

     No, no, no.  He’s had his hand up a long time.

     Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  How concerned are you that Putin wants to go beyond Ukraine into other countries and the U.S. will have to get involved if he moves into NATO countries?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, if he did move into NATO countries, he will be involved — we will be involved.  The only thing that I’m convinced of is: If we don’t stop now, he’ll be emboldened.  If we don’t move against him now with these significant sanctions, he will be emboldened.

     Look, you know, every — well, anyway.

     Q    And can you talk anything more about your conversation —

     (Cross-talk by reporters.)

     THE PRESIDENT:  I’m sorry, I can’t hear you.

     Q    Sir, India, which is a major defense partner of the United States — is India with — fully with you on the issue of Ukraine and Russia?

THE PRESIDENT:  Does the Defense Department of the United States —

Q    Sir, India is one of your major defense partners.  Is India fully in sync with United States on Russia?

THE PRESIDENT:  We’re going to be — we’re in consultation with — with India today.  We haven’t resolved that completely.","Representatives of NATO countries strongly condemned the Russian invasion. On February 24, US President Biden condemned the “brutal assault [by the Russian military] on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity.” He noted that NATO would convene to “map out the next steps” to “further strengthen all aspects” of the Alliance.”25 Biden added: “Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies and reassure those Allies in the east.” However, the United States would “defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power” and the Alliance was “more united and more determined than ever.”","Biden: No US troops involved in the conflict, only to defend

2022-02-26,"Department of Defense Statement on Additional Military Assistance for Ukraine
Feb. 26, 2022 |   
The following statement is attributed to Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby: 

Yesterday, the President authorized an additional $350 million of military assistance from Department of Defense inventories, including anti-armor, small arms and various munitions, body armor, and related equipment in support of Ukraine’s front-line defenders facing down Russia’s unprovoked attack. 

This brings the total security assistance we’ve approved for Ukraine to $1 billion over the past year, and it is the third time President Biden expedited emergency security assistance for Ukraine’s defense in recent months using the Presidential Drawdown Authority. 

And, as I have said before, the U.S. is not supporting Ukraine alone. Many other countries are contributing to Ukraine’s ability to defend itself from this unprovoked Russian aggression. We, along with our Allies and partners, are standing together to continue to expedite security assistance to Ukraine, and are employing all available security cooperation tools in support of the Ukrainian people as they defend themselves against this aggression.

So, our commitments and deliveries continue as a sign of our unwavering support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.  ","Western statements, in turn, were accompanied by actions, which however remained limited to economic sanctions and military aid. Thus, in the days following the invasion, the United States, the European Union, many other European states, but also Canada, Japan, and Australia, adopted an unprecedented sanctions package against Russia;29 and on February 26, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby announced “an additional $350 million in military assistance” for Ukraine, “including anti-armor, small arms and various munitions, body armor, and related equipment in support of Ukraine’s front-line defenders facing down Russia’s unprovoked attack.”"," Western states decide to only impose economic sanctions
upon Russia and deliver military support for Ukraine.

that the immense costs of the war could well be the beginning of the end for Putin. She feared, however, that Putin was determined to use the most unsightly means. Thus, she urged Russia, not to escalate the conflict, but noted that the West had to be prepared for Russia trying to use even the worst

Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu (right) and Chief of the General Staff of Russia’s Armed Forces – First Deputy Defence Minister Valery Gerasimov.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Colleagues,

You see that Western countries are not only taking unfriendly economic actions against our country, I mean the illegitimate sanctions of which everyone is well aware, but top officials of the leading NATO countries are indulging in aggressive statements directed at our country.

Therefore, I order the Defence Minister and Chief of the General Staff to put Russian Army’s deterrence forces on high combat alert.","Even more disconcerting than the decision in Minsk, on February 27, Putin ordered Russian Defense
Minister Sergey Shoigu and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov to put Russia’s “deterrence forces,” which include nuclear weapons, on a “high combat alert.” Putin cited “unfriendly economic actions” taken against Russia by Western countries, namely the “illegitimate sanctions,” and
“aggressive statements” directed at Russia as reasons for the decision.35 It was not initially clear what
specific steps would accompany this decision.3"," Putin: Russian deterrence forces will be placed on “high combat alert.”
",r,E,
2022-02-28,"Putin’s decision to elevate the alert status of Russia’s nuclear forces is both a signal of how much Ukraine means to the Russian leader, and a deterrent against future Western actions. European allies must continue to present a unified response, while also exploring opportunities for de-escalation.

Until now, nuclear weapons have largely been in the background of the Ukraine conflict. That changed when Russian President Vladimir Putin elevated Russia’s military status to ‘special service regime’, including its nuclear forces. In practice, this ‘special status’ could mean higher readiness and survivability of the Russian nuclear command authority along with its nuclear forces.

Putin is a nuclear bully. He has much more at stake in Ukraine than NATO does and is willing to escalate the crisis to get his way. None of this is new. What this announcement signals, however, is two things: resistance to the Russian invasion is hurting, and Putin is getting desperate. While the first point should inspire hope for Ukraine and Europe, the second necessitates caution because options for a face-saving resolution to the crisis, without resorting to massive casualties, are dwindling for Putin. But there are still a few off-ramps left, and NATO can also play a role in reducing risks of further escalation.

Any analysis of Putin needs to come with a degree of humility. He has proven to be mercurial; both perceptive in understanding Western red lines and reluctance to use force, but also short-sighted in anticipating Ukrainian, NATO and Russian responses. This latest move, therefore, can be read in at least three ways.

First, this could be a response to Western actions and a means to push back against sanctions, which were mentioned in the announcement. From a Western perspective, this might seem asymmetrically escalatory. But Russia’s 2020 nuclear doctrine states that the role of Russia’s nuclear forces is not only deterrence, but also to guarantee ‘the protection of sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state … and in the event of an outbreak of a military conflict – the preclusion of the escalation of military actions and their cessation on conditions acceptable to the Russian Federation and (or) its allies’. So, while Western sanctions might not obviously threaten the sovereignty of the state, they do have the potential to dramatically undermine the Russian economy, not to mention the leadership’s personal wealth.

The change in nuclear status should be seen more as a symbol of Putin’s willingness to take risks with nuclear threats, rather than necessarily his willingness to use nuclear weapons
A second option is that the announcement could be a response to Ukrainian resistance and is intended to bully the country into submission. Nuclear weapons are a powerful reminder of Russia’s military strength. According to the same nuclear doctrine, if Russia perceives it is losing the conflict in Ukraine with unacceptable conditions, that could suggest the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. This would be an incredibly dramatic decision and seems extreme. The change in nuclear status should be seen more as a symbol of Putin’s willingness to take risks with nuclear threats, rather than necessarily his willingness to use nuclear weapons. Putin has consistently demonstrated a strong appetite for risk. Escalation is about stakes. And the stakes for Putin in Ukraine are high.

Third, the decision to increase the alert status of all Russian forces, including nuclear weapons, could be an anticipatory deterrent against further Western support for Ukraine. The majority of military analysts believe that Russia will ramp up its attacks on Ukraine and the worst is yet to come. Until now, Russian troops have been careful to avoid any civilian casualties, but the next stages of the conflict could include a massive aerial assault on Kyiv and a ground invasion with little regard for life or property. The heightened nuclear alert status could be intended to deter Western powers from directly intervening in the crisis when the conventional fighting escalates.

Is NATO willing to fight a nuclear war over Ukraine? Probably not. Its options, therefore, must strike a delicate balance between deterrence and de-escalation. In response to Putin’s announcement, NATO’s priorities should be deterring Russian aggression against NATO members and reassuring allies. Actions to date, including the recent decision by Germany to increase defence spending and provide military assistance to Ukraine, have demonstrated remarkable resolve and unity on the part of NATO. The Allies must continue to send a strong, unified message of approbation against Putin, while also avoiding escalation and exploring opportunities to de-escalate and ultimately resolve the war.

But Putin seems to be intentionally driving past all the off-ramps. He has consistently proven willing to escalate the crisis in Ukraine. His risk-taking is brazen. So, while NATO and the EU attempt to walk a fine line between deterrence – with ever-increasing sanctions and military aid to Ukraine – and de-escalation, Putin consistently pushes the crisis further along. Ultimately, the Ukrainian people will be the ones to suffer the most from his actions.

Putin is the one who has introduced nuclear threats to this crisis; NATO does not need to resort to similar desperation
The international community needs to respond strongly to Russia’s shocking attack. Nevertheless, any denouement to the crisis will require a face-saving option for Moscow. For Putin, the greatest threat to Russia since the end of the Cold War has not been NATO expansion, but the Colour Revolutions on Russia’s borders. Maintaining domestic support and his personal hold on power is his top priority. Getting out of the crisis, therefore, will require not only that he feels secure about Ukraine’s future status, but also that he feels secure at home. At present, it is hard to envision such a scenario, but the priority should be slowing the pace of conflict and facilitating crisis communication.

There are at least three off-ramps available. First, Putin and Zelensky might agree to a ceasefire and move the conflict to the negotiating table. That does not necessarily entail a peaceful conclusion to the conflict, as Russia could re-engage militarily, but it would provide a short-term easing of the pressure on both sides. Second, Putin could claim victory and seize Donetsk and Luhansk, exaggerate the military achievement to audiences back home, and leave the rest of Ukraine. Again, this could simply turn into yet another frozen conflict in the region, and will likely only drive Ukraine further towards the West. Finally, an outside party could intervene and offer to mediate the crisis. This would provide a strategic pause.

If Putin continues to drive past these off-ramps, however, it is hard to envision a resolution to the conflict that doesn’t include a growing number of civilian casualties. Bullies should be met with strength, but events to-date have demonstrated that NATO’s true strength comes from unity and non-military options. The best it can do for now is to stay that course and continue to insist it does not present a military threat to Russia. Putin is the one who has introduced nuclear threats to the crisis; NATO does not need to resort to similar desperation.","Then, on February 28, Shoigu declared that he had implemented Putin’s order by adding additional
personnel at various locations – “shifts on duty” at “command posts” had been “put on enhanced combat duty.”37 Experts consequently classified the decision as largely symbolic.","Shoigu: High combat alert = more personnel.

2022-02-28,"ISGUR: Not going to change the balance of the court. She's well within, sort of, the Breyer to Sotomayor range there. And Republicans have the wind at their backs when it comes to 2022. The last thing they want is to get stuck in the mire of a Supreme Court nomination. They want this to be a referendum on Joe Biden.

Now, the problem is, that may be the interest of the overall party. Individual senators on the Senate Judiciary have their own incentives to try to, you know, spruce up their name ID that they're fighters.

You know, I think the number one question she'll face from Republicans is actually not that much about her. It's ""You are one of the most qualified judges in the country to be on the Supreme Court, but a lot of people who are qualified weren't even considered for this position because of their race. Do you think that that's right?""

(LAUGHTER)

STEPHANOPOULOS: Does she get Republican votes?

ISGUR: Yes.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Donna, let's talk about the State of the Union. You saw the question I asked Jen Psaki earlier. The president is coming into the State of the Union in a pretty tough position, 37 percent approval. The Democrats are facing real headwinds heading into the midterms.

What does he need to do Tuesday night?

BRAZILE: Well, first of all, George, I call it 20/80/80, 20 percent looking back, 40 percent talking about the president. I mean, he is going to come before the nation at a time when there are dark clouds of war in Ukraine, the breadbasket of Europe. So he's going to have to talk about the present crisis, not just in Ukraine, but also inflation, also what's happening at the gas pump.

He also needs to do 40 percent in terms of the future. Where do we go from here?

I mean, he's passed several important pieces of legislation. Where do we go on the pandemic? Where do we go in terms of, you know, competitiveness with China. There's a lot on his plate. But the first thing he should do is not talk to the men and women in Congress. I love them. You know, I used to be a Hill staffer. Talk to the American people because they want to hear from their president. And project strength.

STEPHANOPOULOS: That is the biggest opportunity for every president every single year. It's the day -- it's a huge audience. How does the president capture it?

ISGUR: I think the worst thing the president can do is stand up there and tell the American people something that is not their reality. If he stands up there and says ""The state of our union is strong,"" people are going to roll their eyes. And at a time where his approval numbers are not only low, but they're getting lower, he needs to stand up there and level with the American people and let them recognize that he understands reality.

The state of our Union is challenged. It’s not great. Inflation, gas prices, Ukraine -- recognize that reality and bring the American people with him about how tough this is and the mistakes that he's made maybe in Afghanistan and other places.

I think that's actually this reset moment that he could have. But I just don't believe the White House will do it.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC “THIS WEEK” ANCHOR: Jon, it's always tricky for presidents in challenging times to get that balance right between optimism and recognizing the reality that most Americans are facing.

JONATHAN KARL, ABC NEWS CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Let's face it, George, State of the Union Address is the biggest audience that he will face. But State of the Union Addresses rarely move the needle much.

And Joe Biden needs to change the trajectory here. His approval ratings are at the lowest point of his presidency, truly grim. If you look at this approval rating, it is virtually in this -- indistinguishable from where Donald Trump was at the various low points of his presidency.

And more concerning for Joe Biden and for Democrats generally, is if you look at our latest poll out today, the percentage of voters saying that they will vote for Republicans in the midterm elections is at the highest level that we have seen since 2010. And you know what happened in 2010. 2010 is when Republicans won 63 seats and swept control of the House in the Tea Party wave.

So, Biden needs to change the trajectory. He needs to acknowledge the challenges and present some kind of a vision that shows he has a plausible plan for dealing with the challenges facing this country.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And, Rachel, when the president enters the chamber on Tuesday night, he'll be facing a Democratic Party which is feeling a bit besieged. Right now, you’re seeing more than 30 retirements in the House, who are saying they’re not going to run again. Republicans, as Sarah said, do feel they have the winds at their back.

RACHEL SCOTT, ABC NEWS CONGRESIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Oh, definitely, George. A 30-year high when it comes to Democratic retirements, especially in the House. The number right now is at 41.

And so, Democrats here, they're looking at the challenges. They're hearing from voters in their district, especially some of these vulnerable Democrats, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia.

Hearing about concerns about inflation. Just look at our latest poll. Six out of ten Americans saying they're feeling a hardship from inflation.

This is also a party right now that is trying to figure out the messaging. They're looking at some of the domestic agenda that has been stalled. There has been a lot of private conversations happening behind the scenes with Democrats focusing on what they can -- have gotten done rather than what they have not, and trying to change the gears ahead of this critical midterm elections when they’re trying to keep the House and the Senate.

STEPHANOPOULOS: It does appear, Donna, that Build Back Better is pretty dead.

DONNA BRAZILE, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think it's dead, George. Look, anything can be revived especially in politics. And I just want to say, Scripture tells us that, you know, whipping endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.

Sarah, I know that there's a great challenge not to appear joyful, but you know what? Compared to where we were a year ago, two years ago, four years, I think we're in better shape.

ISGUR: That's not true for a lot of Americans, though.

BRAZILE: No, no, hold on -- look, I can't speak for every American. I can only speak for myself.

But the fact is more companies are onshoring their jobs. Intel is going to start making chips in Texas and Ohio.

Tell the good news so that the American people know we're fighting to make their lives better. That’s what I mean by whipping may endure for a night, because joy can come in the morning if we believe that America’s greatest days are ahead of us.

That's what the State of the Union is. It's not just projecting the pain, but the passion of what makes us Americans.

I’m thinking about the people in Ukraine. The grandmothers with the AK-40s.

George, I don’t even know what that look like, okay? If you put that on the candy store, I’m like, I don’t know any of those. But the fact that they're fighting, they're defiant, that is what this moment is about. And I think the president can project that on Tuesday.

STEPHANOPOULOS: And, Jon, there's no question the president's speech is going to be transformed by Ukraine, by the fact that, you know, the war is going on as he's speaking.

KARL: Absolutely, an extraordinary moment, George. We see the aggression that -- by Russia. We see a threat to the world order like we have not seen since World War II.

This will have in a sense the feeling of a war time speech and in face of this aggression, this would be a moment of unity, you would expect a moment of unity. And yet you see the previous president coming out, Donald Trump, and as you mentioned in your interview with Tom Cotton, essentially praising Vladimir Putin, condemning the president of the United States.

This is not normal. It's not right. It's not what you would expect to see in a time of national crisis. So, he's going to be facing a chamber that will have -- where he's looking at a Republican Party that is deeply divided on this question, and has an opportunity here to channel some of President Zelensky, channel some of the notion of standing up in face of the type of aggression that we haven't seen in more than a half century.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC “THIS WEEK” ANCHOR: Sarah Isgur, this does seem to be a moment of crisis for the Republican Party. It’s why you got President Trump out there calling Vladimir Putin smart, saying he has no message for him. You got Tucker Carlson, probably the leader of the media in the Republican Party, who did an about face this week after praising Putin, and refusing to condemn what seemed to be happening in Ukraine.

I want to ask you what I asked you off camera. I honestly -- and this is an honest question. I don't understand why someone like Tom Cotton, Senator Tom Cotton, who has been stalwart against President Putin for years, is unwilling to condemn that kind of rhetoric from Donald Trump.

SARAH ISGUR, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Because it doesn’t end, right? We saw this in 2015. If you end up responding to Donald Trump, then you respond to Donald Trump the entirety of your candidacy or whatever you’re doing.

STEPHANOPOULOS: It's the most important issue out there.

ISGUR: And Tom Cotton certainly was showing differences that he had with President Trump in terms of policy. But, look, you have Vice President Pence, Mitch McConnell, lots of people breaking from President Trump, but sort of that higher level. And what they have in common is that they don't need to raise money right now. Twenty-two cents of every dollar being raised on the Republican side is going into Donald Trump's PACs. It has such a far-ranging effect that we’re not even thinking about, that f you want to raise small dollar online donations, the vast of majority of where these candidates are getting their money, it's either going to Donald Trump or you have to rent those lists, emails, et cetera from Trump lists.

And so, you got to have a Trump friendly message if you want to raise that money. It's a huge problem for the Republican Party, because those high level people can break with him all they want, but if the candidates have to stay close to Donald Trump in order to be competitive, it affects who can run and it certainly affects who can win.

STEPHANOPOULOS: The rest of the world does seem to be uniting behind Ukraine right now.

DONNA BRAZILE, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: And also, all the former presidents have come out and condemned Mr. Putin's aggression.

George, look, I can't speak for the Republican Party and whether they're going to break from the former president. But I can tell you, the American people are united and standing behind the Ukrainian people and our NATO alliances. I think that is what matters in this moment.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Hey, Rachel Scott, what more can we expect from Congress? There seems to be bipartisan support now for tougher sanctions, even as the president seems to be getting ahead of that over the weekend.

RACHEL SCOTT, ABC NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, and this is something that both Democrats and Republicans actually wanted to get done before they left on recess. But there were sharp disagreements on how far to go, how soon to impose sanctions.

And so, it just didn't happen. All that amounted to was a strongly-worded resolution essentially just condemning Russian aggression. So, I think now that senators are back on Capitol Hill this week, we can start to hear more of these calls for imposing harsher sanctions, trying to get Democrats and Republicans on the same page. But, again, they've struggled to remain united on this front when it comes to responding to what is happening in Ukraine, what’s happening with Russian aggression.

But definitely expect to hear more pressure even from Democrats. We started hearing it from Senator Blumenthal and other Democrats who said the president just should have acted sooner. He should have imposed those harsher sanctions earlier.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Jon, what does this mean for the Republican Party going forward?

KARL: Well, the Republican Party is divided on foreign policy in a way that it hasn't been since World War II. I mean, you do have strong voices in the Republican Party that channel Ronald Reagan, that are stridently anti-Russian aggression, anti-Putin.

But you also have prominent voices in the party that are frankly cheering him on. You know, as you pointed out, it's not just members of Congress. It's obviously the former president and some of the loudest voices in -- on the conservative side. I mean, I don't know if it's conservatively, but on the Republican side, actually not just saying that it doesn't matter, but praising Vladimir Putin. It's incredible.","White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki saw the Russian decision as part of a typical pattern of the
Kremlin, artificially fabricating threats to justify further aggressive actions. Russia had not been
threatened by NATO or Ukraine at any time, she said.

",w,D,
2022-02-27,"Thank you to all of you for attending this press conference after the fourth meeting of the [EU] Foreign Affairs Ministers in a week.  

Everybody perceives that we are in unprecedented times, that we are living a historic moment. And I know that the word “historic” is often overused and abused, but this is certainly a historic moment. For two reasons.

First, because it is the first time since the end of World War II that a military power invades another sovereign state in violation of the international rules. And, secondly, because Europeans have been reacting in a way that has surprised a lot of people – to start with the Russians themselves – and it is often said that the most important advances in the European construction are made through crisis, during the crisis or due to the crisis, and I believe that maybe we are in one of these moments, when a crisis allows us to advance, [to] move forward. And another taboo has fallen these days, the taboo that the European Union cannot use its resources to provide arms to a country that is being aggressed by another.  

Yes, these are unprecedented times. Because the war is back in our borders. That is why it is a defining moment for European history, a page of history has been turned and we have been working around the clock during these days. And I am proud to see that the European Union has been able to show its capacity to deliver, to help its neighbours with the idea of urgency. This is good, to be able to deliver with the idea of urgency when one of our neighbours and partners is being invaded by Russia.  

During the weekend, we have been working very hard and we want to take some decisions that should be in place, agreed and [with] a Legal Act implementing them before tomorrow, when the Central Banks will restart working.  

This was an informal meeting, you know that it does not take specific decisions or concrete actions. It provides political agreements that will be converted on legal instruments and precise and concrete decisions by written procedure in the following hours.  

But the [Foreign Affairs] Council has been giving its assessment, its support, its political agreement for a package of support to the Ukrainian armed forces. For new sanctions, for diplomatic engagements in order to isolate Russia, for measures to support Ukraine and the region, and measures to counter disinformation.  

Since there is a fully-fledged war in Ukraine, and we want to do everything to support Ukraine, we have decided to use our capacities to provide arms, lethal arms, lethal assistance to the Ukrainian army for a value of €450 million support package and €50 million more for the non-lethal supplies – [such as] fuel and protective equipment. 

All this will be covered by our European Peace Facility and inter-governmental fund. This is the first time in history that we will be doing that. Everybody agreed – or at least did not obstruct – this decision. 

I want also to thank Poland, who has offered to serve as a logistic hub for the transfer of this material assistance to Ukraine. Because now we have approved the financing. Tomorrow, the Defence Ministers will meet in order to coordinate how we convert this financing into material and how this material is being transported to the front line, to the Ukrainian armed forces fighting against the Russian invasion. Thanks to Poland for serving as a hub. We will also work to enhance the cyber-defence of Ukraine. 

On sanctions, we have agreed to increase [the number] of people and entities that are going to be subject to restrictive measures. The full list will be finished by the Coreper and will be published tomorrow. 

This includes Russian oligarchs and businessmen, whose listing carries huge economic impact, and political figures who hold key roles on Putin’s system in Russia - both the ones who disseminate propaganda and military. 

In addition, we have decided to close the European Union airspace to the Russian aircrafts. Not a single Russian aircraft will be able to land or to take off from the European Union airfields. 

In accordance to the agreements that President [of the European Commission, Ursula] von der Leyen already anticipated yesterday after working with the G7 Members, we are taking a package of measures that the Council has approved - with some questions about the scope – but with full support to these measures that are really effectively crippling the Russian financial market. We are excluding a certain number of Russian banks from SWIFT – you know that this was something that we have been talking about and you, the press, have been asking about it for days. It was discussed at the European Union Council the other day. At that moment there was not the necessary consensus, but immediately after we continued working on it, because – as we said – everything is on the table. We have continued with that, working with our like-minded partners, because such a measure has to be taken in coordination with other countries - it is difficult to take this kind of measure alone – and reached an agreement to take out of SWIFT a certain number of Russian banks and impose restrictive measures that will paralyse the assets of the Russian Central Bank. More than half or about a half of the financial reserves of the Russian Central Bank will be frozen thanks to this measure. Because they are held in banks of the G7 countries, and this represents, more or less, half of the reserves of the Russian government. This will be frozen, and this is going to be affecting a lot of the financial system of Russia. 

As I said, this is being done in coordination with our international partners with the clear message that Russians who enable the invasion of Ukraine will have to pay a very high price for this action.  

We are going after the wealth of Putin’s elite, people who support him and benefit from this regime. And, in addition to this new package of sanctions, we are advancing work on sanction regimes targeting corruption specifically as well as foreign information manipulation and interference.  

Third line of work of the [Foreign] Ministers today was to engage in diplomatic efforts - they are already producing results, as you have seen in the vote at the United Nations Security Council, no one supporting Russia – and work in order to make the widest possible international condemnation and isolation of Russia. Russia will be isolated by the international community. 

One of the results of our collective diplomatic outreach was the vote in the United Nations Security Council and now it will be on the Resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, which is expected on Wednesday.  

We are carrying out an intensive diplomatic effort to isolate Russia as much as possible in international and regional organisations.  

The Council of Europe has already suspended Russia’s right of vote. Discussions in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) are ongoing. And there will be an important debate at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday. We will continue on that line.   

The fourth is to support the people affected by the conflict, who will be in need of humanitarian assistance, people who are leaving the country – we cannot call them migrants, they are just refugees looking for asylum, escaping the war. We are extremely worried about the humanitarian dimension of this tragedy, and we need to act rapidly in order to support these people and support the countries that will receive them. We have activated our EU Civil Protection Mechanism and 18 Member States are channelling critical humanitarian equipment to Ukraine. People in Ukraine and people leaving Ukraine. We will have to face a challenging situation, but we are ready for it. Let us see what happens in the following days, but certainly the number of people leaving Ukraine is increasing.  

Last point that will interest you, that work in the information industry. We need to tackle disinformation. We need to counter the Russian state-controlled narrative.  

Because disinformation is becoming massive and is now shifting to full-fledged war propaganda.

Look at our reports, look at the website of [the European External Action Service] Strategic Communications [team], EUvsDisinfo, and you will see how Russian media describes what is happening in Ukraine and how are they describing President [of Ukraine, Volodymyr] Zelenskyy. 

We need to be vigilant about obvious manipulation because Putin not only wants to conquer space, he also wants to conquer people’s minds. We have to fight against it. 

For that, we are going to ban Russia Today and Sputnik from broadcasting in the European Union. Because they are the champions of information manipulation. 

We also agreed to strengthen our support to independent media in Ukraine and Russia.  

Last but not least, we are worried for what might happen in the whole region. We are afraid that Russia will not stop in Ukraine. The Russian influence can start working in the neighbour countries, Moldova and Georgia, and will also have an impact in the Western Balkans.  

We need to pay lot of attention to what is happening there. I am planning to visit Moldova in the same way that I visited Ukraine on the first days of this year. 

We have to remain vigilant on the impact of the crisis in the Western Balkans and look at what is happening, at the positions, at the alignment with our foreign policy of the countries in the Western Balkans who are candidates to the European Union.

To conclude, this is a defining moment for the European Union to demonstrate strategic and global leadership in a united manner. To act united and quickly. This is also an occasion to think about what the European Union is and what we want the European Union to be, because the challenges that we are going to face as Europeans will increase. We have to be prepared for that, for us and for the future generations.  

We say often that the European Union was born in the aftermath of World War II, because we wanted to get peace and prosperity. And we got peace and prosperity. The European Union is a peace project. We want to continue fighting for peace, for us and humankind.  

We want to keep peace in Europe, but we have to be prepared to defend this peace. What is happening in Ukraine will be an awakening moment for the people who believe that, only united, Europeans will be able to face the challenges of the future.  ","Also on February 27, as a result of a foreign ministers’ meeting, the European Union announced the
delivery of weapons and lethal support to Ukraine worth 450 million euros. In a press conference, Josep Borrell, the European Union’s top diplomat, stated that this would include the delivery of fighter
jets, which Ukraine had asked for: “We are going to supply arms and even fighter jets. We are not talking just about ammunition; we are providing the most important arms to go to war,” Borell said. “We
know what kind of planes [the Ukrainian army can operate] and some Member States have these kinds of planes.”43 Borell was referring to fighter jets of the Soviet MiG or Sukhoi type, which for example Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia reportedly owned.44 Media later suggested

2022-03-01,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russian nuclear submarines sailed off for drills in the Barents Sea and mobile missile launchers roamed snow forests Tuesday in Siberia after President Vladimir Putin ordered his nation’s nuclear forces put on high alert over tensions with the West over the invasion of Ukraine.

Russia’s Northern Fleet said in a statement that several of its nuclear submarines were involved in exercises designed to “train maneuvering in stormy conditions.” It said several warships tasked with protecting northwest Russia’s Kola Peninsula, where several naval bases are located, would join the maneuvers.

In the Irkutsk region of eastern Siberia, units of the Strategic Missile Forces dispersed Yars intercontinental ballistic missile launchers in forests to practice secret deployment, the Defense Ministry said in a statement.

The military didn’t say whether the drills were linked to Putin’s order on Sunday to put the country’s nuclear forces on high alert amid Russia’s war in Ukraine. It also was unclear whether the exercises represented a change in the country’s normal nuclear training activities or posture.

Putin’s decree applied to all parts of the Russian nuclear triad, which like in the U.S., consists of nuclear submarines armed with intercontinental ballistic missiles, nuclear-tipped land-based ICBMs and nuclear-capable strategic bombers. The United States and Russia have the two largest nuclear arsenals in the world, by far.

The U.S. said Putin’s move unnecessarily escalated an already dangerous conflict, but so far has announced no changes in its nuclear weapons alert level, perhaps in part because it was unclear what the Russian president’s order meant in practical terms.

Russia and the U.S. have the land- and submarine-based segments of their strategic nuclear forces on alert and prepared for combat at all times, but nuclear-capable bombers and other aircraft are not. One party raising the nuclear-combat readiness of bombers or ordering more ICBM-carrying submarines to sea would ring alarm bells for another.

Compared to the U.S., Russia relies more heavily on nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are located in silos or mounted on mobile launchers. A change in their readiness status could be more difficult to spot and assess.

Putin’s order heightened already soaring tensions, drawing comparisons to the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis that saw Moscow and Washington teetering on the brink of a nuclear conflict.

In announcing his decision, Putin cited “aggressive statements” from NATO powers and new, crippling Western sanctions that froze Russia’s hard currency reserves, an unprecedented move that threatened to have devastating consequences for the its economy and finances.

The latest statements from Putin and other Russian officials indicated the Kremlin view of Western sanctions as a threat on par with military aggression.

Dmitry Medvedev, a deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, responded Tuesday to French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire commenting that the European Union would unleash an all-out economic and financial “war” against Russia.

He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. 

He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready.  Here is what we did.   

We prepared extensively and carefully. 

We spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin. 

I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.  

We countered Russia’s lies with truth.   

And now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable.

We are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine. 

And we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering.  

Let me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.  

Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies – in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.  

For that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. 

As I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power.

2022-03-02,"A three-way fighter-jet deal to bolster Ukraine’s defenses against Russia is dead — just five days after the White House first revealed an openness to making it work.

With Kyiv begging U.S. officials for more military support, the prospect of Ukraine reaping a windfall of MiG fighter jets caught the world’s attention this past week as the country fights back Russia’s invading forces. But after a dizzying series of public statements, diplomatic messaging and blunt offers to swap the Russian-made planes for American aircraft, it all fell apart.

The saga that started 11 days ago with an errant comment by a top European Union diplomat ended unceremoniously when the chief Pentagon spokesperson and the head of the U.S. European Command separately declared Wednesday that the U.S. wouldn’t take part in an agreement to give warplanes to Poland after it sends its fleet to Ukraine.

“We do not support the transfer of the fighters to the Ukrainian air force at this time and have no desire to see them in our custody either,” John Kirby told reporters, conveying the main sentiment of a Wednesday phone call between Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Polish counterpart. He added that the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence community assessed the warplanes wouldn’t materially improve Ukraine’s chances, but instead would escalate the prospects of drawing NATO directly into the fight.

Pentagon: Transferring additional jets to Ukraine provides ‘little increased capabilities at high risk’

SharePlay Video
Officials in Kyiv, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a weekend Zoom call with U.S. lawmakers, have pressed hard to acquire European fighter jets, claiming the enhanced airpower would help them inflict further damage on Russian forces. Videos posted to social media during the two weeks of fighting have shown the invading army massed in large, slow columns bottlenecked on roads, where Ukrainian-operated Turkish drones and ground troops with Javelin missiles have turned hundreds of Russian vehicles into burning husks.

But skeptics inside the Biden administration pushed back on the idea of green-lighting the transfer of Poland’s MiG-29 fighters to Ukraine, and President Joe Biden sided with those skeptics, three U.S. officials said.

“POTUS will do what the military advises here and the advice now is not to do this and instead send the Ukrainian government more things they can make good use of,” a senior administration official told POLITICO. Ukraine has “many planes they already don’t fly much because of Russian air defense.” The official added that it’s “not clear what sending more planes achieves.”

The list of objections is long, from the logistics of getting as many as 28 fighter planes over the border into Ukraine to the stickier issue of flying fighter jets from a NATO country into a war zone, which some officials thought would make the alliance more of a participant in the fight than it already is. The administration considers that overt support as more offensive than the anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles they’re flowing into Ukraine from Poland and Romania.

Blinken: Complexities exist when it comes to providing security assistance to Ukraine

The transfer might have been possible if the deal was kept under wraps, but that became impossible after Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign affairs and security policy chief, declared unequivocally to reporters on Feb. 27 that the bloc would provide Ukraine with fighter jets. The announcement came as a shock to many, U.S. and European officials said, including aides in Eastern European capitals who hoped to keep the transfer quiet.

But the Ukrainian government heard the proposal and ran with it, producing infographics claiming they were about to receive 70 used Russian fighter jets from Poland, Slovakia and Bulgaria. A Ukrainian government official told POLITICO that Ukrainian pilots had even traveled to Poland to wrap up the deal and bring the planes back over the border.

Yet Borrell’s bloc, much less the countries actually tasked with supplying these jets, had never agreed to this plan.

The deal was seemingly scuttled on March 2 by Polish President Andrzej Duda, who declared flatly that Polish jets would not enter Ukrainian airspace. The Slovakian and Bulgarian governments told POLITICO they weren’t going to ship any of their MiGs to Ukraine either.

Then things started getting weird.

On Saturday, POLITICO reported that the White House was mulling an audacious three-way deal: Poland would send the MiG-29s to Ukraine, and the U.S. would send F-16s to Poland to replace what Warsaw would give away.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed those talks the following day on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.”

Poland has a “green light” to send its warplanes, he said. “In fact, we’re talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians.”

“We’re in very active discussions with them about that,” he added.

Five U.S. officials said there was general agreement within the administration that Washington should work with Warsaw to support Ukraine. But staffers from the Pentagon and intelligence community opposed the three-way plan, namely because they feared the move would drag NATO — and thus the U.S. — into a direct confrontation with Russia. Additionally, the Pentagon voiced concerns that the F-16s required to backfill Poland would need extensive downgrading so as to not potentially compromise highly classified avionics systems installed on those planes.

White House questioned by reporters on not sending fighter jets to Ukraine

SharePlay Video
Biden, per three U.S. officials, agreed with the cautious Pentagon and intelligence view, in part over concerns that Russia would see America openly helping NATO send fighter jets into Ukraine as an escalation.

However, the White House made clear to Poland the U.S. wouldn’t oppose its sovereign decision to deliver the fighter jets if it chose to do so. What the administration couldn’t guarantee was a speedy delivery of the F-16 backfill, telling Warsaw that approving that transfer could be a monthslong process.

To break the deadlock, Poland went for the Hail Mary. In a surprise Tuesday announcement, the Polish government said it was ready to transfer its 28 MiG-29 fighter planes to the U.S. Under the deal, Polish pilots would bring the planes to Ramstein Air Base in Germany, and in return, Warsaw expected the U.S. to hand them over to Ukrainian pilots fighting off the Russian invasion.

It was not what the U.S. had initially considered when first hatching this idea with European allies.

“The proposal evolved from something the EU would look at to something that individual EU allies would look at to the latest iteration where we would broker. It’s a far cry from where we were several weeks ago,” a senior State Department official told POLITICO.

The announcement caught the Biden administration by surprise.

“To my knowledge, it wasn’t pre-consulted with us that they planned to give these planes to us,” Victoria Nuland, undersecretary of State for political affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday. “I was in a meeting where I ought to have known about that just before I came. So I think that actually was a surprise move by the Poles.”

The administration moved quickly to shut down Poland’s offer. “We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland’s proposal is a tenable one,” Kirby, the Pentagon spokesperson, said Tuesday night.

The tenor in Washington abruptly changed on Wednesday, the same day German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared Polish warplanes would “certainly” not land in Ramstein. “We might’ve been in a different place if this hadn’t turned into the Poles putting this on the table,” the senior State official said.

Blinken told reporters that the U.S. was still open to a deal, but only one in which Poland could send “security assistance” to Ukraine “in the right way.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki then said during her daily news briefing that the U.S. had “understandable concerns” about the Polish proposal.

And that’s when Kirby went up to the Pentagon podium to tell reporters — but really Poland — that the U.S. wasn’t going to do the deal, and listed all the reasons that sending extra MiGs to Ukraine was a bad idea. He also noted that there was no daylight between the State Department and Pentagon’s positions on the issue, saying they both agree it’s not America’s place to tell Poland “what to do or not to do.”

Gen. Tod Wolters, the U.S. European Command chief, shortly after backed up what Kirby said.

“The transfer of MiG-29 aircraft will not appreciably increase the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force. The Ukrainian Air Force currently possesses numerous mission capable aircraft that are flying daily. Adding aircraft to the Ukrainian inventory is unlikely to change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force relative to Russian capabilities. Therefore, we assess that the overall gain is low,” he said in a statement.

Officials in Warsaw, who are already dealing with a flood of Ukrainian refugees and acting as the main hub for pushing Western weapons into Ukraine, didn’t want to act alone in sending the jets.

Appearing alongside Vice President Kamala Harris in Warsaw on Thursday, Polish President Duda said his government “wanted NATO as a whole to make a common decision,” about the jets, “so that Poland remains a credible member of NATO — not a country who decides on its own important issues which impact the security of NATO as a whole.”

But the rationale hasn’t quieted critics.

The Pentagon’s concern over Moscow’s reaction to sending jets to Ukraine is “pure deterrence of the U.S. military by the Russians,” said Dave Deptula, a retired Air Force lieutenant general who planned the air campaign in the 1991 Gulf War. “If we transfer a pocketknife to Ukraine, Putin’s going to object to that. A weapons system is a weapons system, and NATO is giving Ukraine rifles and missiles, so it’s time to give them airplanes.”

Even if Kyiv doesn’t have the pilots to fly the MiGs, the Polish planes could be used for spare parts for the Ukrainian MiG-29s flying hard hours against Russian forces, Deptula said.

While the Russian air force has stepped up airstrikes in recent days, the war in Ukraine remains largely a ground conflict. There have been a few reports of aerial dogfights, and of aircraft from both countries targeting ground forces. But American military officials have said that two weeks into the war, neither side maintains air superiority, and that both sides have significant anti-air capabilities.

The Ukrainian armed forces on Wednesday claimed to have shot down 56 Russian aircraft, though that number is unconfirmed by any outside sources. Videos have emerged of several Russian fighter planes downed by Ukrainian anti-aircraft systems.

British Defense Minister Ben Wallace said Wednesday that the U.K. was considering sending the laser-guided Starstreak shoulder-fired anti-aircraft system, a significant upgrade from the Stinger missiles sent by the U.S., Germany and other allies. The weapon has a range of over 4 miles and can take down fighter planes more effectively than the Stinger.

“We believe the best way to support Ukrainian defenses is by providing them the weapons and the systems that they need most to defeat Russian aggression, in particular anti-armor and air defense,” Kirby said Wednesday. “We, along with other nations, continue to send them these weapons and we know they’re being used with great effect.”

But Ukraine’s Zelenskyy no longer wants to wait for more Western assistance. He wants the jets, and blasted the U.S. and Poland as Russian bombs continued to pockmark his country, and as lumbering Russian columns continue to grind along his country’s highways, slowly encircling his capital city.","Just one week after it had been announced, the delivery of fighter jets by EU states was put on hold – apparently also mainly due to efforts to avoid escalation with Russia. For example, at a joint press conference with Stoltenberg on March 2, Polish President Andrzej Duda declared his country was not sending “any jets to Ukraine because that would open a military interference in the Ukrainian conflict.” Poland was “not joining that conflict,” and NATO was “not a party to that conflict.” Warsaw was “supporting Ukrainians with humanity aid” but was not “going to send any jets to the Ukrainian airspace.” Stoltenberg made similar comments, noting that the Alliance had provided “different types of military support: material, anti-tank weapons, air defense systems and other types of military equipment” as well as financial support, but that NATO was “not to be part of the conflict” and was not “going to send the troops into Ukraine or move planes into Ukrainian airspace.”58 According to media reports, Slovakia and Bulgaria also rejected the delivery of MiG fighter jets to Ukraine.5","Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria, NATO will not send MiGs to Ukraine.

2022-03-03,"Question: Unprecedented sanctions pressure is being exerted on the Russian Federation due to the recent events, primarily “on the ground.” Has Russia changed its position? Does the world hear what Russia is saying? What do you think about the ongoing talks in Belarus? What should we expect from the next round?

Sergey Lavrov: This is a comprehensive question. You have touched on many issues. I am sure the world is listening to Russia, but it is difficult to say at this point the extent to which it hears us. The majority may understand what this is about, but they have to obey the toughest dictate.

Speaking frankly, it is of course bad when people die: military servicemen and civilians (women and children). This has been happening in Donbass for eight years and is now happening during Russia’s special military operation. The goal of this operation is to stop any war that could take place on Ukrainian territory or that could start from there.

I have no doubt that a solution will be found. Our minimum terms are well known. They are being discussed, in part, at the talks with Ukrainian representatives. Talks were held in Gomel and new talks were supposed to take place today. However, the Kiev team has again found some reason to postpone the talks. There is no doubt whatsoever that Ukraine receives instructions from Washington; they are not independent at all. Nevertheless, talks must take place. I will not go into the details of the agenda; they are well known. We can no longer tolerate the threat of direct attack on the Russian Federation from the territory of Ukraine. Such threats are fixed in the current doctrinal documents of the Kiev regime. One of the main reasons is Ukraine’s unrelenting desire to join NATO and the reluctance of the Alliance’s members to fulfil their commitments that they do not take any measures that would enhance their security at the expense of the security of others.

In the final analysis, this is not just the situation in Ukraine, the efforts to demilitarise and de-Nazify it, to prevent the continuing manifestations of genocide on its territory, putting a stop to any violence and ensuring for the Ukrainians an opportunity to decide their destiny themselves; no, it is the world order that is at stake. This is for a reason that the West is avoiding, in any way it can, giving a response to our implicit, clear-cut proposals on the security system in Europe that rely on existing agreements.

I mentioned the core principle endorsed at the top level by the OSCE which underlies Russia-NATO relations. Each country has the right to choose alliances. However, no country can strengthen its security at the expense of the security of any other country. No organisation can claim dominance in the Euro-Atlantic space, which is exactly what NATO is doing now. The West strengthening its security at the expense of Russia’s security has become proverbial. We are being told “not to worry because Ukraine or any other country joining NATO will not pose a threat to Russia’s security.” Why should the West tell us what our security needs are? Just like the Americans decided for Germany and Europe what was needed for European energy security. They decided that Nord Stream 2 was something that the EU did not need for its energy security, which would be ensured instead by supplies of liquefied natural gas from the United States at multiple times the cost.

The fact is that we are being listened to, but not heard. They are trying in every possible way to impose on us their idea of how to continue living in Europe.

The comparison suggests itself. In their time, Napoleon and Hitler set out to subjugate Europe. Now, the United States has taken it over. There was no question about NATO, and the European Union was shown its place. The story of Nord Stream 2 vividly illustrated the EU’s actual place in the international arena. It was coerced into doing what it is now doing, end of story. Now, they have started talking and Western capitals are issuing demands. The picture being created on the world stage is like something out of Hollywood, showing absolute evil and absolute good represented by the main character, who also happened to script this “action movie.” It’s sad.

I’m sure the hysteria will pass. Our Western partners will, for lack of a better word, get over it eventually. We remain ready for dialogue, but on one indispensable condition which is this dialogue must be based on equality, respect and consideration for each other’s interests.

Question (retranslated): President of Russia Vladimir Putin is described in the West as an isolated man who is reacting emotionally. When did you speak with him last? Is he taking advice?

Sergey Lavrov: You are choosing to characterise what the President of Russia is doing and how based on Western propaganda.

In the past few weeks, President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly explained in detail our view. It reflects the position of the Russian leadership, arrived at in full conformity with the constitutional powers of the President of the Russian Federation and such structures as the Foreign Ministry, the Defence Ministry, special services and the Security Council of Russia. This work is being carried out on a daily basis. Permanent Security Council members meet at least once a week. This is the decision-making mechanism.

Question (retranslated): Despite all the nuclear fears, Russia and the United States have managed to maintain stability for decades. Can you reassure the world by saying that Russia will not lose its head and be the first to use nuclear weapons?

Sergey Lavrov: We have a military doctrine that describes the parameters and conditions for using nuclear weapons. There is no “escalation for the sake of de-escalation” there, though Western analysts claim otherwise.

Talk of nuclear war has already begun. Look carefully at these statements and the characters who made them. First, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a propaganda frenzy, trying to curry favour with the most radical forces in the West, that nobody would ban the North Atlantic Alliance from doing whatever it wants, even if it suddenly decides to deploy nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe. To begin with, NATO cannot decide where to deploy nuclear weapons. It does not have them. The Americans do. Stoltenberg’s comment was very revealing.

Next, Vladimir Zelensky started saying that they would renege on their obligations as a non-nuclear state and acquire nuclear weapons. Remember this as well. Do not forget to look at what was said by my colleague, Foreign Minister of France Jean-Yves le Drian. He loves to show off, you know. The rooster is a national symbol of France. They often get cocky. During one of his chats with the world, he said Vladimir Putin must remember that France also has nuclear weapons. Neither President Putin nor I are saying this. Other people started this talk. The recently appointed UK Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss said she was prepared for conflict between NATO and Russia. Please note what US President Joseph Biden has said. When asked whether there was any alternative to the current “sanctions from hell” he said World War 3 was the only alternative to these sanctions. It is commonly understood that World War 3 means nuclear war. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the thought of nuclear war is constantly running through the minds of Western politicians but not the minds of Russians. I assure you that we will not let any provocations cause us to lose our balance. But if a real war is unleashed against us, this must be a concern for those who are hatching such plans. And I believe these plans are being hatched.

Question (retranslated): The world is witnessing Russian bombs killing people in Ukraine and we keep hearing the lies that the Russians are telling about these attacks. The world has come together to condemn them. How can you defend this position?

Sergey Lavrov: You read your question from a piece of paper. The question is short, but still you chose to read it off the piece of paper. I cannot comment on the fakes which abound. It may have come to your attention that primarily Europe and the United States are trying to shut down Russian media and sources of information about the developments in Ukraine, the ongoing special military operation and the way the Ukrainian army, the Ukrainian neo-Nazi battalions are treating civilians. When they retreat, they plunder the areas on their way out. In Donbass, the self-defence units of Donetsk and Lugansk began to drive them out. They take people’s vehicles and equipment, and behave like looters and thieves. There is a lot of information about provocations being prepared, including in Mariupol and other places, where the Ukrainians are trying to use civilians as human shields. Ask the Indian, Arab, or African students who are trying to leave Ukraine, but they won’t let them go. Just yesterday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke with President Vladimir Putin. He is concerned that an Indian student died in Kharkov, Ukraine. There are no Russian troops in Kharkov. But we see foreigners who want to depart, including across Russian territory, being prevented from leaving at the Kharkov railway station. We are ready to accommodate these students. I don’t have enough time to list all the instances. I encourage you to visit our Ministry’s website, which provides a detailed description of what the Kiev neo-Nazi regime is doing. I know you are fond of the word “kill.” The real killers are fighting on the side of the Kiev regime.

Question (retranslated): Do you believe that President Vladimir Zelensky, the first Jewish president of Ukraine, whose family died during the Holocaust, is a Nazi?

Sergey Lavrov: I believe he is being manipulated by nationalists and neo-Nazis. Otherwise, I find it difficult to explain how President Zelensky can “preside” over a society where neo-Nazis and neo-Nazism are flourishing. They openly hold marches and torchlight processions, and he has his guard of honour stand guard as they do so. They conduct exercises, learn methods of urban warfare, sabotage, and provocation. All of that is happening under President Vladimir Zelensky. He claims that his grandfather fought on the fronts of WWII. Look at the laws he signs. How can a president, who is a “citizen of the world” (as every Jewish person is supposed to be), sign a law on indigenous peoples of Ukraine? Russians are not listed among the indigenous peoples. How can a president who is not a racist sign and support laws that ban the Russian language not only in schools (which is ugly in and of itself), not only in education, but in everyday life as well? You cannot ask a pharmacist for medications in Russian. By the way, Crimea (which some people in the West worry so much about) has three state languages – Russian, Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian – which was never the case under Ukrainian rule. Any Russian citizen living in Crimea can come to any federal or local office and speak his or her native language, and they must answer them in the same language. The list goes on and on. I know that you go for catchy images and so you don’t have time to deal with the facts and really understand them. For once, spend at least 30 minutes to read what’s posted on the website of our Ministry, or on the website of the Russian Defence Ministry. I know that you will not be allowed to raise your voice. Yesterday, President of France Emmanuel Macron said that it was a lie to accuse Vladimir Zelensky and Ukraine of allowing Nazism to flourish. He got his answer already. However, the best answer came from his fellow citizen, a French journalist who visited Donbass and described the shelling of a school, the death of two women, two teachers who worked at that school, and she shamed the Western leaders who refuse to see it. Of course, she was not allowed to publish this, but her comment is still available on social media. I encourage you to learn about the facts rather than try to pretend that the same Hollywood “action movie” is unfolding according to the script about absolute evil and absolute good which was written by your colleagues.

Question (retranslated): Not so long ago we interviewed some European officials. They said NATO really did not want to expand eastward. Russia was not supposed to have any problems with this. Now such statements are no longer made. Why have these changes appeared and why were such Russian media as Sputnik and RT blocked in the EU? We are seeing disinformation from social and traditional media. What is your response to all this?

Sergey Lavrov: What is my response to all this? This fact is well known and cannot be concealed. The Soviet leadership and then the Russian leadership was reassured that NATO would not move to the east, that not a single piece of NATO’s military infrastructure would appear to the east of the Oder River. You know what happened afterwards. President Vladimir Putin has spoken about this many times. There were five consecutive waves of NATO expansion. Moreover, each time the rhetoric, military planning and exercises of this alliance became increasingly directed against the Russian Federation.

We have talked about this and explained it many times. But we did not see a response that would indicate NATO’s readiness to speak on equal grounds, based on respect for each other’s interests and concerns. I deliberately cited statements that were made at the highest level in the OSCE in Istanbul in 1999, in Astana in 2010 and the statements of the Russian and NATO leaders at the summit in Pratica di Mare in 2002. It was clearly said that nobody would enhance their security at the expense of the security of others and that not a single organisation in the Euro-Atlantic region had the right to claim domination in the OSCE space. NATO members are categorically refusing to honour both.

You have asked me a very good question: Why is this happening and why do they need to maintain this position? I see no other explanation but the stubborn, relentless desire to maintain their superiority in all areas and show everyone that it is NATO that is dictating orders in Europe. Now Yens Stoltenberg has said that NATO bears global responsibility for global security. So, all this talk about the defensive character of the Alliance is cheap talk, “in favour of the poor” as we say here. If the Alliance was defensive it would have had to defend itself by now. But nobody has ever attacked it. And yet the Alliance decided itself: Now we are defending ourselves along the conventional Berlin Wall. Then the Berlin Wall was gone – why don’t we defend ourselves somewhere else? Then they started moving eastward. Each time, they drew a defensive line independently and unilaterally. It has already approached the Russian Federation. This was explained many times. President Vladimir Putin explained this explicitly in his public statements and long conversations with Western leaders. When they speak with us at the bilateral level, they seem to show understanding, but something happens with them as soon as they get together. Apparently, what happens is that they are already ruled by the United States that is issuing orders and instructions to them. It’s sad. We remain open to a conversation. It is bound to start eventually anyway.

Everyone knows that a coup d’etat took place in Ukraine. It was not provoked by anything. It took place a day after the President and the opposition signed an agreement on early elections which the opposition was bound to win.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin asks his colleagues: Why did they stage this coup? If there had been no coup the afore-mentioned agreement would have been fulfilled. It wouldn’t have occurred to anyone to start an uprising in Crimea against the putschists. Crimea would have remained Ukrainian. We have said and explained all this.

But in the current situation we cannot tolerate this threat because Ukraine has been turned into “anti-Russia”, into a bridgehead for undermining everything Russian. This continued for a long time. This was part of a big geopolitical game. Do your remember Zbigniew Brzezinski said that Russia and Ukraine together were a superpower? I believe he also said that it necessary to make every use of Ukraine to undermine Russia’s interests, influence and culture. I’d like to emphasise that he urged his colleagues to use Ukraine to cause the collapse of the Russian Orthodox faith, which is now being actively done. President Petr Poroshenko started this line and President Vladimir Zelensky is doing much to support it. So, there is no lack of goodwill on our part but we cannot allow and will not tolerate continuous crude encroachments on our interests that create a physical threat to Russia’s security.

Question (retranslated from English): What is your assessment of the current situation after the talks with Ukraine?

Sergey Lavrov: I cannot say now what the situation will be like after the talks. The talks have not started yet. I believe the head of the delegation, who is holding talks with Ukraine, will make a statement as soon as they are completed. Then we will learn all about it.

Question (retranslated from English): Russia is isolated in the diplomatic arena, with only four countries having voted against the resolution calling on Russia to stop its military operation immediately. For perhaps the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO is united as never before. In diplomatic terms, it has been a fiasco, or a defeat for Russia, has it not?

Sergey Lavrov: That is for you to judge. I cannot judge my actions or my country’s actions. We are confident that we are doing the right thing.

I want to say again that it is bad, very bad that people are dying.

I am not thinking of a diplomatic fiasco but rather of the West’s “talent” for diplomacy. Thousands of people died – about 14,000 people died over the eight years of war in Donbass. Not a single person from your channel or any other media outlet in the West has ever thought of travelling to Donbass to see how people whom the Ukrainian regime declared terrorists, although they had never attacked anyone, live there. They were attacked and called terrorists. These people come under fire every day, civilians are killed there, schools and kindergartens are destroyed and acts of terrorism are committed.  

If you choose what the West says as the criterion for your professional actions, then so be it. If you call those eight years of silence on the part of Western media and Western politicians and eight years of torpedoing the Minsk agreements, with the Ukrainian regime not only failing to implement the agreements but continuing to use force against civilians – if you call those eight years of choosing to ignore and remain silent a diplomatic triumph, that is your right. You represent an independent media outlet, as I understand. Russia has stood up for its interests and NATO, as you said, is finally united as never before. Has NATO sought to bring back the reason for justifying its existence? The reason vanished following the breakup of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Treaty Organisation. Later, it was Afghanistan. Recently, NATO has triumphantly pulled out of Afghanistan. However, this event failed yet again to provide motivation for uniting and keeping a tight rein on all allies. What strategic autonomy is President of France Emmanuel Macron talking about? Nobody will ever allow anyone to have strategic autonomy. The United States has already shown it clearly. This is, perhaps, the diplomatic triumph of the United States. But then I will not say who in Europe is suffering a diplomatic fiasco.

As for the arithmetic you mentioned, we know well what methods our Western colleagues use to achieve results like these: pure blackmail and arm-twisting. They tell all counties without exception and without mincing words: there will be voting and you must vote the way we tell you. They say this to officials in foreign countries who have accounts in the West and whose children study in universities in Western countries. Exactly like this, without ceremony. I know this because many of my friends tell me that such pressure is being put on them: “I’m sorry, we can’t vote differently, it is my life, and the life and well-being of my family.”  Yes, these methods are used to achieve a diplomatic triumph. My congratulations to you. However, the truth will out ultimately.

Again, I want to invite you to visit the Foreign Ministry website for irrefutable documentary evidence of what Ukrainian military and neo-Nazis were doing in Donbass and other parts of Ukraine. That is why we are not feeling political loneliness.

Question: Is the plan to bring back Viktor Yanukovych to power in Kiev? Is this the endgame for Russia?

Sergey Lavrov: Again, your question shows that you came to this interview without even reading through what President Vladimir Putin and I have said on multiple occasions. It is up to the Ukrainian people, or rather all the peoples living in multi-ethnic Ukraine, to decide on the future of Ukraine and on who should be their leader.

Question: I have a question about Polina Zakhodinskaya. She was in her final year of primary school. She was shot dead by the Russians as she was in her family car in Kiev on Saturday. Mr Lavrov, I know you have a daughter yourself. I want you to look me in the eye and just tell me how do you sleep at night knowing that Russian bombs and bullets are killing children?

Sergey Lavrov: I can't add anything to what I have already said. Every human life is precious. Unfortunately, hostilities involve casualties, not only among the military, but also the civilians. Our servicemen participating in the special operation have a strict order to use only high-precision weapons to suppress the military infrastructure. Even the barracks with the Ukrainian military are not targeted.

I can only convey my condolences to the bereaved families.

Question: You say high precision is used, but hundreds of civilians have reportedly already died. This is now being investigated by the International Criminal Court. I wonder if you personally are preparing your defence in a war crimes tribunal?

Sergey Lavrov: You are keen on asking pointed questions, I’m sure you’ll have a big audience. You will charge this audience emotionally. As I understand, this is your job. This is not so much a media outlet as a tool for inculcating what Western leaders need into the people's heads. I’m here to say it again: I do not justify any actions that result in civilian deaths.

We did not come up with the term “collateral damage.” Our Western colleagues came up with it during their reckless undertakings in Iraq, and before that in other countries such as Libya, and Latin America. Have you ever covered the developments in Iraq or Libya with the same emotional zeal? With hundreds of thousands of dead civilians? I can’t remember that. So, I regard your question as rhetorical.

Question: Yes, of course, this is my job, but you started this war, and Polina's blood is on your hands, isn’t it, Mr Lavrov?

Sergey Lavrov: I prefer not to play these games. You're acting as if it’s some kind of a talk show. If you want to know my position, I have outlined it in the most detailed way, including the humanitarian aspects of the ongoing operation.

I understand that you will cover all this the way you need to, but I want you to remember (probably, any journalist on a put-up mission still has a conscience), what you did during these eight years, when little girls, women, and older people were killed by the thousands in Donbass. The Ukrainian regime killed them. Go ahead and visit our Ministry website. I’d rather not take up your time with long stories. And if you are so worried (and rightly so) about the humanitarian consequences of any hostilities, it would be only fair if you looked at the chapters that you have so far preferred not to touch upon in your work.

Question: Russia has officially lost 500 soldiers in just one week of fighting, and other estimates are much, much higher. At this rate, we’re looking at one of the most costly campaigns in recent Russian history, far deadlier that Afghanistan or Chechnya, for example. The official message was that Russians would be welcomed with open arms, and that the Ukrainian army would lay down its weapons. What has gone wrong?

Sergey Lavrov: This is a subjective view. Yes, there are losses. There are always losses in such situations. But I have already spoken about this.

As for what has gone wrong, I don’t think you’re familiar with our plans, which are kept secret. They underlie the operations of our group which is implementing the special military operation on orders from President Putin. Yours is an abstract question.

I would like to point out that this situation cannot be considered separately from all the other developments, from the past 30 years that were full of various events in relations between Russia and the West, and between the West and the rest of the world, in particular the United States.

President Putin has said on numerous occasions that the threat has come right to our border. I don’t think it is a big secret that the Pentagon is seriously concerned about the chemical and biological facilities in Ukraine, where it has built two military biological laboratories that were creating pathogens, in Kiev and Odessa. They are worried now that they will lose control of these laboratories. At the same time, the Americans categorically refuse to establish a verification mechanism in keeping with the Biological Weapons Convention and continue to build its military biological facilities along the perimeter of the Russian Federation. Miliary bases were being built in Ukraine, including by the British, and many other things were taking place there. The CIA had an extensive presence there at all times.

The Ukrainian army was clearly not trained to fight against Poland. When similar events took place in Iraq, the United States announced that they were a threat to the US national security. Has anyone wondered why the US decided to restore order in a country 10,000 kilometres away? ­Nobody did, because this is arrogant great-power behaviour. When Russia pointed to the threat it was facing, we were told that there was no threat at all, and that we were safe.  They think that they can determine the conditions of our security when the threat is right on our border. We don’t interfere in situations 10,000 km from our borders to set things right according to “our rules.” What we are doing now is a forced decision, because they refused to listen to us and instead kept lying to us for the past 30 years.

There will probably come a time when we will need to come to an agreement, but we will only do this on the basis of the principle all sides have adopted:  not to strengthen one’s security at the expense of others’ security and not to claim dominance. Only an equitable dialogue. But our Western colleagues are not ready for this; they are playing at absolute good by grossly abusing diplomatic methods and by forcing small and medium-sized countries to carry out their orders. This happened in global history many times before. So, I wouldn’t jump to conclusions.

The operation is ongoing, and its goals have been stated clearly: the demilitarisation of Ukraine, which means that no weapons that can pose a threat to Russia must be deployed there at any time; the denazification of Ukraine, because the Nuremberg Trials’ verdict has not been reversed; and, of course, guarantees for Ukraine without its admission to NATO. President Putin has pointed out that NATO’s expansion is unacceptable to us, but we are ready to openly discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, for Europe and for the Russian Federation.

Question: Just to follow up on what you said on Russia’s demands. You said yesterday that Russia isn’t looking for Ukrainian capitulation. Are you now prepared to deal with Ukrainian President Zelensky? What exactly does he need to agree to to stop the fighting? Are you looking to take control of the whole of Ukraine before talks make any kind of progress? Does that mean the full destruction of the Ukrainian army?

Sergey Lavrov: No, that does not mean what you have referred to in such an emotional manner. Let me spell this out one more time for you. Despite all my efforts to explain this, I keep getting questions as if no one hears my answers. We are ready for talks. When President Vladimir Zelensky asked to hold talks, President Vladimir Putin immediately agreed and sent a delegation. After that Vladimir Zelensky changed his mind. Probably the Americans told him to slow down. Later they said that they were going to come. They were not there on the agreed day, however, and arrived only 24 hours later. We waited for them there. The talks took place. We communicated our negotiating position to our Ukrainian colleagues. They promised to come to this round of talks with their negotiating position. We are ready to talk, while continuing our operation, because we cannot allow Ukraine to retain infrastructure which poses a threat to the security of the Russian Federation.

We will see to it that the demilitarisation is carried out all the way through, meaning the destruction of infrastructure and weapons posing a threat to us. Even if a peace deal is signed, it will definitely include a provision to this effect.

Question: President of France Emmanuel Macron and President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin are frequently in touch. Do you think President Macron and France have a special role to play for achieving a diplomatic solution?

Sergey Lavrov: France has quite a long-standing tradition of acting as a mediator in various conflicts. We remember President of France Nicolas Sarkozy, who helped settle the situation which started with Mikheil Saakashvili’s criminal order to bomb peacekeepers and South Ossetia. We know that President of France Emmanuel Macron and his predecessor contributed proactively to creating the Normandy format. In fact, it is within its framework that the Minsk agreements were signed. These agreements were an important step in these efforts, but the story did not end there. With the Minsk agreements signed and approved by the UN Security Council, neither France nor Germany did anything to force Ukraine to fulfil them. On the contrary, they started saying that Ukraine does not have to carry them out and that it is up to the Russian Federation to do its part. They said that there must not be any direct dialogue between Kiev and Donetsk or between Kiev and Lugansk because this is all just for show, while the real “culprit” is the Russian Federation. We tried to bring our French and German partners to their senses and showed them the Minsk agreements and the UN Security Council resolutions saying that all key matters must be settled with Donetsk and Lugansk. This did not help.

I have already mentioned that President of France Emmanuel Macron has been quite proactive in his efforts. He has talked with President of Russia Vladimir Putin on the phone quite a few times and visited Russia just recently. Another telephone conversation between them is underway at this very moment. If France succeeds in bringing about an agreement this time, this will only make us happy, as long as the agreement is based on principles approved by the OSCE and enshrined in international relations. However, yesterday President of France Emmanuel Macron said that statements on the spread of neo-Nazism in Ukraine are lies, as I have already mentioned. Hearing this from an ally… Don’t they see any parallels with what is happening in Ukraine regarding Jews and Russians: aggressive statements, torch processions and lots of violent crimes, including in Donbass. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is France’s partner within the Normandy format (which no longer exists, as far as I can see) said that it was ridiculous to describe what is happening in Ukraine as genocide. Hearing this from a German representative is not a very pleasant experience. If our German colleagues are unable to recognise these cues… Olaf Scholz has recently talked about the seriousness of the situation in Europe by claiming that they have not seen anything of this kind for 75 years. Does this mean that our German colleagues forgot or failed to notice how Yugoslavia was bombed, or maybe they just missed the whole thing?

You see, no matter where our discussion takes us, we always come across double standards. This absolute good our American colleagues are now trying to create with your assistance implies that you can do as you please: hand out guilty verdicts whenever you deem necessary and sweep under the carpet things you find inconvenient because of the direct involvement of the West, primarily the United States. I do understand that solidarity and allied relations are important for you, but this does not benefit the world or international relations in any way. What you are now trying to establish in the Russian Federation is a dictatorship without democracy, brotherhood, or equality of any kind.

Once again, we welcome the mediating efforts of President of France Emmanuel Macron. President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin has explained on multiple occasions our vision of settling the current situation.

Question: The European Union gives weapons to Ukraine. Do you consider this an act of war? Do you think there is a risk of sliding into a nuclear war?  

Sergey Lavrov: It is not us who started the talk about a nuclear war. Conversations to this effect were started by your Foreign Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, who urged President of Russia Vladimir Putin to keep in mind that France also had nuclear weapons, and by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, and by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who said that, if necessary, they would deploy nuclear weapons even closer to the Russian Federation.  Foreign Secretary Liz Truss went on record as saying that she was ready for a war between NATO and Russia. This is the talk you are trying to use in a bid to accuse us of all this.  I reiterate: it is not us who bring up the subject of nuclear war, of a Third World War, in these discussions.  It is probably needed to keep the public in the West on tenterhooks, to continue fanning Russophobia until any Russian becomes a target for aggression. Students are expelled, performers are not allowed to perform, and athletes see their wings cut…  Among other things, this is a case of dishonest, dirty rivalry to make things easier in sports, arts, and other areas of human activity.  This is obscene. My great hope, therefore, is that our main partners will get past this madness. We will be ready to hold talks, but, as I said, solely in a business-like, pragmatic, and equitable manner. If they hope that the world will be different after what is going on now and that Russia will keep its head down and obey the diktat, they are up for a great disappointment. They should remember Russian history. 

Question: One of my colleagues mentioned the results of voting on the General Assembly’s resolution. You are certainly familiar with these results. You must also be familiar with how the Security Council voted. Given this attitude towards Russia's current approach, do you think Russia's foreign policy priorities, its development vectors might change in any way, maybe switch gears? So far, no security guarantees have been provided by the West. We have heard from you many times how important this is. Do you think the campaign Moscow has launched in Ukraine will result in some kind of security guarantees provided to Russia by the West?

Sergey Lavrov: All conflicts end in agreements, so this isn’t up to us. Our approach is well known. No one has listened to us for 30 years. The West is perfectly aware of our concerns. Endlessly ignoring them with such arrogance has not worked and will not work. Only naive people could have thought otherwise.

As to switching gears – we are ready to work in all areas where there is mutual readiness to do business based on a balance of interests. I can assure you that those countries that have banned their companies from operating in the Russian Federation did so under enormous pressure. They are saying now they are prepared to suffer, as soon as this can “teach Russia a lesson.” Even the Deputy Director of the US National Economic Council said the United States would like to avoid a sharp rise in oil prices because it would benefit Russia. Do you understand? Not because fuel prices at gas stations would rise, American voters would not be happy about the inconvenience and would be dissatisfied with their government – but because it would benefit Russia. Their minds only work one way – how to punish Russia as much as possible. Indeed, this affects both the economy and the social sphere. I assure you that we will deal with whatever problems the West creates for us out of its determination (I emphasise once again – not to ensure their own security, this isn’t about the security of the West at all) to use Ukraine as a tool and a pretext to prevent Russia from pursuing an independent policy. There are few countries left on Earth that can afford such a luxury. Sanctions are a tax on independence, if you like.

Returning to your second question about security guarantees, I have quite enjoyed rereading an article that John Mearsheimer, a professor at University of Chicago, wrote in September 2014 after the events in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. He said the West was steering Ukraine along the path of false expectations towards an imminent crash. “The United States and its allies should abandon their plan to westernise Ukraine and instead aim to make it a neutral buffer” and boost its economy. Ukraine doesn’t have to be caught in the middle, between Russia and NATO. That would be the best option for Ukrainians. But instead, we are inciting Ukraine to gang up on the Russians. We are enticing Ukraine with the idea that one day, the country will become part of the West, and we will defeat Putin. And things will be just as we want them. And time is on our side. Well, Ukrainians are happy to play this game of course. And they no longer want to compromise with the Russians. On the contrary, they want to take a tough stance. Well, if they do, it won’t end well for them. What we are doing now is provoking just such an outcome. I believe it would make much more sense to create a neutral Ukraine. It is in the US interests to end this crisis as quickly as possible. It is in Russia’s best interests as well. And most of all, it is in Ukraine’s best interests.

He wrote this seven and a half years ago and published it in Foreign Affairs. A very authoritative and respected publication the White House and the Department of State listen to. Yet, apparently, this time it was not heard. I am sure that the White House and the American leadership are aware of this opinion. But alternatives are simply ignored because the real aim is different. Their aim is not to protect Ukraine’s security while relying on a balance of interests of Ukraine, the United States and Russia. It is to demonise and finish off the Russian Federation. This was the original goal. Now, unfortunately, there are no doubts left.","On March 2, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova expressed skepticism with
regard to a possible Russian nuclear escalation. “We assume that this apocalyptic scenario [of Russia
using nuclear weapons first] cannot be realized under any pretext and under any conditions,” she said. “When it comes to the use of nuclear weapons, we have already stated our position several
times. Perhaps you are confusing us with the United States, but the Russian Federation has never spoken about this.”61
In a March 3 interview, Foreign Minister Lavrov stated that the goal of Russia’s “military operation”
in Ukraine was to prevent Kyiv from acquiring nuclear weapons. In addition, he made somewhat
cryptic comments about a possible war with the West, yet arguing that Moscow’s nuclear rhetoric
was merely a reaction to Western threats. Thus, Lavrov noted that the French Foreign Minister le
Drian had reminded the Russian leadership that France also had nuclear weapons (see February 24).
The Russian official also commented that British Foreign Secretary Truss had said “she was prepared
for conflict between NATO and Russia” (see February 27). Also, he added that US President Biden had
said that the alternative to sanctioning Russia was World War III. “I would like to draw your attention
to the fact that the thought of nuclear war is constantly running through the minds of Western politicians but not the minds of Russians,” Lavrov concluded. “I assure you that we will not let any provocations cause us to lose our balance. But if a real war is unleashed against us, this must be a concern for
those who are hatching such plans. And I believe these plans are being hatched.”6"," Lavrov: Thought of nuclear war is on Western, not Russian minds. Zakharova: Russia will not use nuclear weapons first.
",r,D,
2022-03-04,"Russia is carrying out a brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which NATO, and the whole world, condemn.  
 
This is the worst military aggression in Europe for decades.
With cities under siege.
Schools, hospitals and residential buildings shelled.
Reckless actions around a nuclear power plant last night.
And many civilians killed or wounded.

The days to come are likely to be worse.
With more death, more suffering, and more destruction,
as the Russian armed force bring in heavier weaponry and continue their attacks across the country.  

At our meeting today, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba addressed his NATO counterparts. 
And Allies expressed their solidarity and deep respect for the courage of the Ukrainian people and armed forces.

We had warned for many months that President Putin was intent on invading Ukraine.
That is why NATO Allies made tireless efforts to find a diplomatic solution.
At the same time, we made clear that Russia would pay a very high price for renewed aggression against Ukraine. 

Russia is paying that price now.

This is President Putin’s war.
One he has chosen. 
Planned.
And is waging against a peaceful country.

We call on President Putin to stop this war immediately.
Withdraw all his forces from Ukraine without conditions.
And engage in genuine diplomacy, now.

NATO Allies have stepped up support for Ukraine.
Helping to uphold the country’s right of self-defence, as enshrined in the U.N. Charter.

Today, ministers addressed our immediate response to the crisis.
And the longer-term implications for Euro-Atlantic security. 

We have already strengthened our deterrence and defence.
On land, in the air, and at sea.

Allies from North America and Europe have sent thousands more troops to the eastern part of the Alliance.

We are deploying the NATO Response Force for the first time. 
And we have over 130 jets at high alert. 
And over 200 ships from the High North to the Mediterranean.

We will continue to do what it takes to protect and defend every inch of NATO territory.

NATO is a defensive Alliance.
Our core task is to keep our thirty nations safe.  

We are not part of this conflict.
And we have a responsibility to ensure it does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine.
Because that would be even more devastating and more dangerous.
With even more human suffering.

NATO is not seeking a war with Russia.   

The Kremlin’s ambition is to recreate a sphere of influence.
And deny other countries the right to choose their own path. 

So ministers discussed the need to support partners who may be at risk. 
Including Georgia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. 

Russia’s aggression has created a new normal for our security.
Where fundamental principles are contested through the use of force. 
And we face the threat of conflict for years to come.  

There is much at stake.
How we organise relations between states.
Whether democracy or authoritarianism prevails.
And ultimately, what sort of world we want to live in.

Ministers agreed that NATO’s relationship with Russia has fundamentally changed for the long term.
But we remain committed to keeping channels for diplomacy and de-confliction open.
To avoid any unintended escalation, misunderstanding, or miscalculation.  

There is one lesson we can already draw from this crisis.
To keep our nations safe, we need North America and Europe standing together in NATO, in strategic solidarity.
At this dangerous moment, no country and no continent can go it alone.

President Putin has failed to divide us.
NATO is more united, more determined, and stronger than ever. 

We are also working closer with like-minded partners.
Today, we were joined by the European Union.
As well as Finland and Sweden.

In response to Russia’s aggression, we have decided to strengthen our coordination and information sharing with Finland and Sweden. 
Both countries are now taking part in all NATO consultations about the crisis.

And this afternoon, I will join a meeting of EU foreign ministers to address the crisis and our response.

And with that, I am ready to take your questions.

NATO Spokesperson Oana Lungescu: BBC.

James Landale (BBC): Can you tell us a little bit more about what sort of options were considered about helping countries like Georgia and Bosnia. Secondly, can you tell us a little bit more about whether NATO Allies discussed what more military support could be provided for Ukraine? And thirdly, was the issue of no fly zones even discussed at this morning’s meetings? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: NATO has provided support and NATO Allies have provided support to Georgia, to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and other partners for many years. We help them with capacity-building, reforms, strengthening their defence and security institutions. We also have a training centre in Georgia. We also have common exercises. And, of course, we have different kinds of activities with different countries, different partners. We didn't make any final decisions. But it's a broad agreement that we need to do more to support these countries. And this is partly about scaling up things we already do on strengthening their defence and security institutions, reforms, training, but also potentially adding more activities in support of these countries. Because what you have seen with Ukraine, is that they may be at risk, exposed for even more intervention, subversion, and potentially even attacks by the Russian armed forces of the Russian Federation.

Then, NATO Allies provide support to Ukraine. I think we have to remember that Allies have provided support to Ukraine for many years and now they're stepping up different types of support. And this is crucial in this critical time for Ukraine. On the no fly-zone, it was mentioned. At the same time, Allies agree that we should not have NATO planes operating over Ukrainian airspace, or NATO troops on Ukrainian territory.

NATO Spokesperson: CNBC.

Steve Sedgwick (CNBC): Thank you, Secretary General. Is there any evidence that the support that NATO and its Allies have been pouring into Ukraine so far is going to change the tide of battle? Although the Russian advances slowed in some places, it is still advancing. Is there anything that NATO is doing that actually could possibly turn the tide in the battle in Ukraine? And secondly, if I may Sir, have events around the nuclear facility, the nuclear plant in Ukraine, and the ramifications from that changed the mind-set of NATO at all? I was wondering what the conclusion was in the meeting about that? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General:  The reckless actions around the nuclear power plant last night just highlight the danger of this war. War is dangerous, and to have military operations, conflict, fighting going around the nuclear power plant adds to the danger. And this just makes it even more important that President Putin ends this war, and withdraw all Russian troops from Ukraine, and engage in diplomatic efforts in good faith. So that was the message from Ministers today. And it's just underpinned by the potential danger of also a nuclear disaster related to this war, or as part of this war.

Steve Sedgwick (CNBC): The first point was about is anything about the military, ammunition, supplies that are going into Ukraine, is that changing the battle at all, or is it likely to?

NATO Secretary General: What we have seen is that President Putin totally underestimated the strength of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. And they have been able to push back, to fight back, and to slow down the Russian advances. And this is, first and foremost, the result of the courage of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. And also the support and the courage of Ukrainian people, and the leadership of President Zelenskyy, which is really strengthening the morale of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Ukrainian people. We have helped that. Because NATO Allies have trained and equipped the Ukrainian Armed Forces for many years. We started in 2014. And NATO Allies especially the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, but also, Turkey have provided equipment and military aid. And we have trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian forces. And they are now on the front line. So this support has proven to be crucial for the strength of the Ukrainian army. And we are now stepping up support with more supplies. And I think also we have to realise that compared to where the Ukrainian army was in 2014, the training NATO Allies have provided, the equipment NATO Allies have provided since 2014 has made the Ukrainian Army much better trained, much better equipped, much better commanded, and much stronger. And this is the reason why they are able to push back the way they are able to do.

NATO Spokesperson: We will go to Interfax Ukraine.

Iryna Somer (Interfax Ukraine): Thank you, Oana. I have a follow-up question on my colleague from the BBC. Secretary General, even General Breedlove, former SACEUR, expressed an opinion that NATO and US have to provide, as soon as possible, help to Ukraine and to close partially, this humanitarian purpose only sky in Ukraine. All Ukrainians are begging for this. Do you think at some point Allies can review this position, how long it will take them guilty enough of Ukraine to be destroyed by Putin?

NATO Secretary General: What is taking place in Ukraine now is horrific. It's painful. And we see human suffering, we see destruction at a scale we haven't seen in Europe since the Second World War. And I would like to commend the courage of the Ukrainian people standing up against the Russian invasion, standing up against Putin’s forces. And that's also the reason why we are stepping up our support. And also why NATO Allies have implemented the most severe sanctions ever. And also why we are mobilising support from the whole world in condemning and calling on Russia, and President Putin, to end this war. At the same time, we have a responsibility as NATO Allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine. Because that will be even more dangerous, more devastating, and will cause even more human suffering. So we have made it clear that we are not going to move into Ukraine, neither on the ground, or in Ukrainian airspace. And of course, the only way to implement a no-fly zone is to send NATO planes, fighter planes into Ukrainian airspace, and then impose that no-fly zone by shooting down Russian planes. And our assessment is that we understand the desperation. But we also believe that if we did that, we'll end up with something that could end in a full-fledged war in Europe, involving many more countries, and causing much more human suffering. So that's the reason why we make this painful decision to impose heavy sanctions, provide significant support, stepping up support. But at the same time not involving NATO forces directly in the conflict in Ukraine, neither on the ground, or in their airspace.

 

NATO Spokesperson: Der Spiegel.

Markus Becker (Der Spiegel): Mr. Secretary General, you said that the aim is to make Mr. Putin withdraw his troops unconditionally. What if it doesn't comply? Is there any other off-ramp you can think of, any opening for negotiations? And if the sanctions don't make him back down, is there a plan B or even an exit strategy?

NATO Secretary General: We are imposing severe costs on Russia, as we warned. We told him, President Putin, that if he invades Ukraine, once again, there will be significant costs for him to pay. And that's exactly what we're doing now with unprecedented sanctions. Of course, these will also have long-term effects and they are working also over time.
Then, Allies are providing support, humanitarian support, financial support, but also military support to Ukraine, helping them to withstand the Russian invasion.

And then, of course, together with a whole world, the UN General Assembly, we're also calling on Russia to engage in diplomatic efforts. To see if there are any political off-ramps, way out.

But then, Russia has to sit down in genuine diplomatic efforts to find the solution.
So far, they have not being willing to do so. A minimum should be to find agreements on a humanitarian corridor or humanitarian corridors to get civilians out and the humanitarian aid in.

I hope that at least that could be a first step. And I welcome all efforts to try to find some kind of agreement on humanitarian support.

NATO Spokesperson: Polish TV.

Dominika Cosic (TVP): Let me go back to rumours from few days ago about Poland and Bulgaria. There were rumours in media that Poland and Bulgaria allowed some..[inaudible] military fighter jets to Ukraine and allow Ukraine to use military airport. Could you comment on this? And could you also comment on the remarks of the Latvian Minister of Foreign Affairs who told for the BBC that NATO should consider all options.

NATO Secretary General: We had a meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers today. And we had the NATO Summit on Friday. And in both those meetings, I have clearly stated that we should support Ukraine, we should continue to provide, NATO Allies should continue to provide military support Ukraine, different types of support.

But we will not be part of the conflict. And that is the NATO position. And I conveyed that message because I strongly believe that if NATO becomes directly involved in the conflict will see more human suffering, more civilians killed.

And that's the reason why we need to step-up support, impose heavy sanctions, call on Russia to engage in a political solution, but not involve NATO.

Our main responsibility, our core task is to protect and defend 1 billion people living in 30 allied countries. We are doing that by increasing the presence of NATO forces in the eastern part of the Alliance, deploying for the first time the NATO Response Force, but we are not going to be part of the conflict with Russia in Ukraine.

[Follow-up question inaudible]
NATO Secretary General: Well, I met President Duda recently. We discussed many aspects and  challenges related to the Russian invasion, brutal invasion of Ukraine. And you saw the statement from President Duda in the Łask airbase, that Poland is not planning to sending any airplanes to Ukraine.

NATO Spokesperson: Ok, we will go to Al Jazeera.

James Bays (Al Jazeera): Secretary General, on his way in the Latvian Foreign Minister said it's time to go from a deterrence mission to a full scale defence mission. So, was there any discussion of sending further troops in addition to the ones that you've deployed in recent weeks? And as you talk about a new normal, was there any discussion of making some of the recent deployments permanent?

NATO Secretary General: We need to distinguish between NATO’s immediate response and longer-term adaptation of our posture in the eastern part of the Alliance. When it comes to the immediate response, we have already significantly increased our presence. We now [have] over 200 ships from the High North to the Mediterranean, and 130 planes on high alert, and thousands of more troops.

I recently visited NATO troops, US troops, German troops and other troops in Romania. I met them in Estonia and also in Poland. So this is the immediate response, and we will do what it takes to defend and protect all Allies and if needed we will further increase our presence.

But at the same time we started at the meeting today the discussion about the more longer term changes to our presence, posture, deterrence and defence throughout the Alliance but especially in the eastern part. And today, we have some presence in the eastern Allied countries, we have the battlegroups in the Baltic countries and Poland, we have some presence also in Romania and in the southeast.

We are now seriously considering a significant increase of that presence, both in more troops, with more air defence, with deterrence by defence, through defence, not only by sending a message of NATO presence. So this is, as some ministers formulated it today, it is about the difference between deterrence by presence or deterrence by defence. We have started that discussion, we will have a Defence Ministerial meeting on the 16th of March. And there we expect more details, we also will of course base our decisions on advice from our military commanders, and then we will take the necessary decisions. But we have some time, not a lot of time but some time, to take that more long-term decision, because we have already implemented immediate responses by a significant increase in the eastern part of the Alliance.

NATO Spokesperson: Ukrainian National News Agency

Dmytro Shkurko (National News Agency of Ukraine): It is understandable that there will be no NATO planes and pilots in Ukraine. But it was recently sounded, the request from the President of Ukraine, about some kind of selling or maybe transferring the planes to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Maybe it could be done in a framework of general technical assistance [inaudible]. And the second question, if I may, as of right now we have absolutely indiscriminate shelling of Ukrainian cities, including the restricted weaponry like for example, [inaudible] bombs, it is deployed in living areas. So can we can count on NATO in collecting at least information concerning the Russian crimes in Ukraine going on right now? Thanks.

NATO Secretary General: The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a blatant violation of international law. And we have seen the use of cluster bombs, we have seen reports of use of other types of weapons which will be in violation of international law. And of course, NATO Allies and partners are collecting information and monitoring very closely what is going on in Ukraine. I also welcome the decision by the International Criminal Court to open an investigation into this, because we have to make sure that President Putin and the President of Belarus are held accountable for what they do.

This is brutality, this is inhumane, and this is violating international law. And we also have to make sure the International Criminal Court really looks into this and that's the reason why I welcome the decision by the International Criminal Court.

[Follow-up question inaudible]

NATO Secretary General: NATO Allies provide different types of military support. I will not go into the details about that support, but Allies provide many types of support. It’s publicly known that Allies have provided anti-tank weapons, air defence missiles and other types of support but more details will not be given by me.

NATO Spokesperson: Bloomberg.

Natalia Drozdiak (Bloomberg): Thank you for the question. You mentioned the risk for Bosnia and Georgia. Are you seeing any concrete threat of invasion there? And what about Moldova, is there any increased risk in Moldova? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: All these are different countries, and of course they face different types of risks and challenges. But they have in common that we have seen Russia trying to exercise their power to intimidate them partly by subversion and interference in the domestic political processes or by military invasion. Georgia has been invaded by Russia and Russian troops still in reality control parts of Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In Moldova and Transnistria, which is part of Moldova, there are Russian troops without the consent of the government in Moldova. And then, in Bosnia-Herzegovina we see a very fragile, unstable situation with inflammatory rhetoric and serious challenges to the unity of that state. So even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, these countries faced serious challenges partly inflicted by or caused by Russia, but the risk has increased. And therefore, we need to step up our support and we need a serious discussion, as NATO, on what we could do to strengthen them in the face of Russian threats.

NATO Spokesperson: We’ll take one question online from Lenta.ru.

Dmitriy Sotak (Lenta.ru): Previously a NATO representative stated that the Alliance is ready to discuss strategic stability issues with Russia. However, the issue of mutual arms control remains an important priority. The problem has not gone away. The level of global tensions has increased after the Russian military command has transferred Russian strategic missile forces to higher alert levels. The question is, is NATO planning any discussions in the foreseeable future on this issue? And why hasn't the Alliance provided Ukraine with modern weapons, which the Ukrainian authorities have been asking for?

NATO Secretary General: Well first, as I said, NATO Allies have provided Ukraine with weapons, especially since 2014. And NATO Allies have trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers who are now on the front line, so we have helped them in standing up against [Russia]. And without that support, without the equipment, without the training, the Ukrainian Armed Forces would have been much less capable of standing up against the Russian invasion. The courage of Ukrainian forces is, of course, the most important factor here, but the training and equipment has been of vital importance. And these, of course, also includes modern systems.

Then, on strategic issues. Well, we reached out to Russia before the invasion because we had intelligence predicting what is happening now. I think we need to understand that actually for many months, NATO Allies and NATO has been warning about that Russia was building up gradually, more and more troops and planning an invasion of Ukraine. But as we saw that build up, we intensified our efforts to engage Russia in some kind of meaningful political, diplomatic dialogue to prevent this invasion. President Putin decided not to find a political solution, but to invade, to use military force. We are of course always in favour of a political solution. But now we face a Russia which is using military force to try to destroy an independent sovereign nation in Europe. The United States and Russia agreed recently to extend the New START Agreement limiting the number of nuclear warheads on long range systems. We believe in arms control. But to have any meaningful strengthening of the arms control architecture we need a Russia which is not killing, and fighting, and invading, but a regime in Moscow which is actually seriously engaging in political efforts to reduce tensions and further strengthen arms control.

NATO Spokesperson: Okay, we'll go with the Jane’s for the last question.

Brooks Tigner (Jane’s Defence Weekly): Yes, sorry to hit you with another weapons question but this really is the crucial issue right now. As you know, the EU is sending half a billion and Poland's the coordinator, which makes me wonder, considering that this new rogue state could attack any country now, my question to you is should NATO create a new permanent structure or at least designate the Allies on a permanent rotating basis to coordinate bilateral weapons transfers from the Allies to anticipate the next crisis. Thanks. I don't mean the trust funds, I don't mean ad hoc consultations during the ministerial but something permanent.

NATO Secretary General: We should always have an open mind to what kind of structures we should have to support partners and countries at risk.

At the same time, I think we need a pragmatic approach. And what we've seen over the last years, for instance in Ukraine, is that NATO provided some types of support. We had an office in Kyiv, we were focused on modernising the defence and security institutions, the command and control, logistics, cyber. And also, we helped them with some naval capabilities. So NATO as an institution, provided important help to Ukraine over many years. And we still do.

But then, on top of that, individual Allies provided more of the lethal aid, more of the military training. Again, I don't think actually, it is so important exactly how we organise this, as long as the country in need receives the support and help they need. And over the years since 2014, there are many, many thousands of Ukrainian troops, forces which are trained at the top level by NATO trainers, special operation forces, and they have advanced equipment, and they know how to use it.

We helped them with cyber defence, with command and control, with communications. So it is this combination of something we do as the Alliance, with the NATO structures, something we do consulting each other, but it's provided bilaterally from NATO Allied countries. And it has been especially the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada who has provided most of the equipment and most of the training.

And then Turkey has provided some key capabilities including drones. And also some of the Baltic states have provided military support before the invasion. Then, after the invasion we have seen many more Allies stepping up. So I don't know whether I really answered your question but we should be pragmatic regarding exactly how to organise this as long as NATO and NATO Allies are able to provide support to partners in need.","Zelenskyy’s NFZ request was however denied at an extraordinary NATO foreign ministers’ meeting to
address the situation in Ukraine on March 4 – with reference to the associated risk of escalation.64 In
the press conference that followed the summit, Stoltenberg condemned Russia’s “irresponsible” actions near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility. However, he stressed that NATO was “not part of this
conflict” and was not seeking war with Russia. The Alliance had a responsibility to ensure that the
conflict did not escalate and spread, he said. That scenario would be even more destructive and dangerous. Stoltenberg also said that NATO continued to believe in arms control, but that such negotiations would require a Russian regime that takes political processes seriously. According to Stoltenberg, the Allies had rejected the establishment of a no-fly zone because such a direct engagement of
NATO states could lead to a larger war in Europe","NATO foreign ministers reject the no fly zone requested by
Ukraine.
",w,D,
2022-03-05,"Before the meeting, the President inspected flight and emergency rescue simulators at the training centre. They simulate a real-life mid-air environment. The President inspected a cockpit allowing pilots to more effectively control the MC-21 medium-haul narrow-body airliner. He also used a simulator to fly a Sukhoi Superjet 100 airliner in the company of Aeroflot flight detachment commander Maria Kasyanik. Vladimir Putin also visited the unique Water-Land centre, whose specialists train flight crews to deal with emergencies, including water landings, mid-air firefighting operations and evacuating passengers via inflatable ramps.Minister of Transport Vitaly Savelyev, who headed the Aeroflot Group just recently, has been asking me for quite a while to come here and to see this training and simulator centre. By coincidence, the well-known events are taking place, and March 8 is approaching. Therefore, he and I decided not to put off the visit any further and to see the facilities you have here, to find out how they are used and to evaluate this centre’s prospects.

I should say that all this is quite impressive. Maria Kasyanik has shown me how to control the aircraft, and I moved the joysticks under her guidance. This is really great, all the more so as next-generation simulators are available, the chief has also discussed them, and I have had a look.

But, of course, we should use this opportunity to discuss the sector’s development prospects. We will probably also talk about the current situation because, naturally, it is impossible to avoid it.

First of all, I would like to congratulate you all on the upcoming International Women’s Day and to wish you and your colleagues all the best. I will be able to address all women of Russia a bit later.

But I would like to say that the sector which we are talking about and where you work and with which you are affiliated employs over 70,000 women, including over 200 pilots and co-pilots, as well as flight attendants, of course, who are a special category and caste.

The people in Russia have always treated aviation with great respect and interest, especially for ladies in aviation. I think the first female Russian aviators emerged in the early 20th century, and they won a reputation for themselves during the Great Patriotic War. We know all those famous names of female aviation regiments and their combat record. Today, women work in all positions, including flight controllers, engineers, technicians, and I repeat once again, flight attendants and pilots. On the whole, this is a substantial female force that supplements the aviation sector’s male section.

I think that is all for opening remarks since it would be more useful and to the point if I answer your questions. So, let’s go over to that part now.

Once again, congratulations on the upcoming International Women’s Day.

Remark: Thank you.

Do you have any questions? Or shall we just have some tea?

Maria Kotova: We have questions.

Good afternoon, Mr President,

My name is Maria Kotova. I am the co-pilot of the Airbus A320 airliner operated by Aeroflot.

My question concerns the current situation in Ukraine. We all support your actions and the special operation underway there. Of course, the most important question that, one way or another, each of us has been asking ourselves lately is: why did this special operation begin? Could it not have been avoided?

In our minds, we understand and strongly support your actions, but as women we worry about our families and loved ones who live in Ukraine. We are aware that the civilians are not impacted. But still, we would like you to reassure us: what is in store for us at the end of this road? What is the military operation in Ukraine supposed to end with?

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: I will provide a brief overview and start, as they say in such cases, from the “centre of the field.” I mentioned this at the beginning of the operation and even before this decision was made, which was undoubtedly a difficult decision to make.

What is this about? The fact of the matter is that after the anti-constitutional coup in Ukraine, which was, unfortunately, strongly supported by Western countries… Let us face it. They are not hiding the fact that they spent US$5 billion on it, handing out cookies on Maidan and so on. And then, instead of bringing the situation back on track, even if it spiralled out of control, even if it was what is known as an excessive act – there is such a legal concept, that is, they planned one thing, but did another. Anyway, they could and should have brought this situation back onto the political track. Moreover, right before the coup, three foreign ministers came to Kiev in 2014, signed an agreement with the incumbent authorities and acted as guarantors of these agreements to the effect that the situation would remain within the political track.

Nothing of the kind. They carried out a coup d’état and supported the perpetrators. Then followed the well-known events related to Crimea and southeastern Ukraine, Donbass, whose residents refused to support the coup.

As you know, Crimea made a decision, people came to the referendum and voted to once again become part of the Russian Federation. Naturally, we could not but support this, all the more so since they were threatened by nationalists and neo-Nazis. There is a great deal of evidence that they were right.

Later on, or practically in parallel, events started in Donbass. What was the outcome? People who began to resist these developments were persecuted. The Kiev authorities started conducting military operations on that territory. They conducted two large-scale punitive operations with the use of heavy weapons and combat aircraft. They attacked Donetsk directly with tanks and bombed its squares from aircraft.

Both military campaigns failed. They sustained defeat. This was followed by the emergence of the so-called Minsk Agreements or the Package of Measures, to use its official name. They showed the way to a peaceful settlement of this conflict. And we did everything we could to let the developments follow in this vein to restore Ukraine’s territorial integrity and protect the interests of the people who live on these territories.

And what did they demand? Basic things: the right to speak their mother tongue, this is the Russian language, and follow their traditions and culture. There were no special demands. Nothing special.

But no. These territories were put under siege and switched off from the banking system, food supplies and payments of pensions and other benefits. Sometimes, some handouts were thrown in. But to receive those benefits and pensions people had to cross the delimitation line.

Now listen carefully. Maybe this will sound rough but the situation compels me to say such things. You see yourselves that stray dogs attack people in different regions. They injure and even kill people (this is a separate problem and the local authorities must deal with it). Then we see how these dogs are poisoned and shot dead. But, look, people in Donbass are not stray dogs. From 13,000 to 14,000 people have been killed over these years. Over 500 children were killed or mutilated.

But what is most intolerable is that the so-called civilised West preferred to turn a blind eye to these events during all these years. Over eight years!

Moreover, recently the Kiev authorities began to say bluntly that they are not going to fulfil these agreements. They are saying this from TV screens and online. They are saying on the record: “We don’t like them, we won’t do anything.”

Meanwhile, Russia continued to be accused of failing to fulfil these agreements. This is simply nonsense, the theatre of the absurd: the white is called black and the black is called white.

It has been getting worse lately. Suddenly, there has been renewed talk about admitting Ukraine to NATO. Actually, it has been on for a long time, but has intensified lately. Do you understand what this could lead to or even can still lead to? If Ukraine is a NATO country, then in accordance with the North Atlantic Treaty, all other members must support that country in the event of a military conflict.

No one is recognising Crimea as a part of Russia, except for you and me. They carry out military operations in Donbass, and they will also move into Crimea, and we will have to fight with the entire NATO organisation. Do you see what that means?

Are the consequences clear enough? I think that everyone understands.

Now they are talking about gaining a nuclear status, that is, acquiring nuclear weapons. We cannot ignore such things either, especially because we know how the so-called West acts with regard to Russia. First, Ukraine has had nuclear competencies since the Soviet times. As far as enrichment and nuclear materials are concerned, they are capable of launching such projects. They have missile competencies. Suffice it to mention Yuzhmash – it created intercontinental ballistic missile equipment for the Soviet Union. They can boost it and do it. And they will also receive help with that from across the ocean. And then they will say that we do not recognise their nuclear status, that they did it themselves, and they will put these systems under control, and from that moment, from that very second, Russia’s future will change dramatically. From then on, our strategic adversaries would not even need to have intercontinental ballistic missiles. They would be able to keep us at the nuclear gunpoint, and that would be it.

But how can we let this go unnoticed? These are absolutely real threats, not some far-fetched nonsense. And our young men who are fighting there now are giving their lives, they are giving their lives to fight for our future, for the future of our children. This is a completely obvious thing.

People who do not want to understand this, especially among today's leadership, must understand that if they continue to do what they are doing – I have already said this too – they will call into question the very future of Ukrainian statehood. And if this happens, it will be entirely on them.

What is happening now? I have already spoken about the goals we have identified.

The first is to protect the people who live in Donbass, of course. How? By demilitarising and denazifying Ukraine and giving it a neutral status. Why? Because a neutral country will not be planning on joining NATO. Right now, their Constitution says they are planning to join NATO. You understand, they included this in the Constitution.

What is meant by denazification? I have spoken with my Western colleagues about this: “So what? You also have radical nationalists.” Yes, we do, but we do not have people with extreme views in the Government. And everyone admits that they have them. Yes, maybe we have some idiots who are running around with the swastika, but do we support this at the government level? Do we have thousands of people parading with torches in Moscow or in our other regional capitals, with the swastika and with torches, like in the 1930s in Germany? Do we have this? But they do, and they support it. Do we support those who killed Russians, Jews, and Poles during the war? Do we hail them as heroes? But they do.

What is happening now is also very important. Look, foreign citizens have been taken hostage in Sumy and Kharkov – over 6,000 young people, students. They were driven to a railway station and have been kept there for three days. We told everyone about this and sent this information to the current leadership of Ukraine. “Yes, yes, of course, we will deal with it now.” We informed the leaders of major European countries about this. I spoke to them personally. “Yes, yes, we will influence them right now.” We told the UN Secretary-General about this: “Yes, yes, we will settle this problem now.” But nobody is doing anything about it.

They treat even worse those people whom they consider their own citizens. They are simply using them as a human shield.

This is taking place in Mariupol now as we are talking with you. They called us from the government, from Kiev and spoke with our military: “Provide humanitarian corridors so that people can leave.” Of course, our people responded instantly and even suspended hostilities. They looked at what was happening. Nobody was allowed out. Do you understand what they are doing? They do not let anyone leave but are using people as a human shield. Who are they? The neo-Nazis, of course.

We note the presence of militants from the Middle East and some European countries there. We know about them, we hear them in the air. They are using so-called Jihad mobiles – they stuff cars with explosives and drive them towards the troops. But they fail to achieve anything and they won’t reach their aims.

Who are they if not neo-Nazis? It is by these actions that they are destroying their own country and their statehood.

Therefore, one of our key demands is demilitarisation. In other words, we are helping people, residents of Donbass to achieve a neutral status and demilitarisation of the country because we must understand clearly what weapons are there, where they are deployed and who controls them.

Different options are possible here. We are discussing them now, in particular, with representatives of the Kiev government during the talks in Belarus. We are grateful to President Lukashenko for organising this work and helping us conduct them. Our proposals are on the negotiating table. We hope a group of negotiators from Kiev will respond positively to them. This is more or less what I wanted to say. Let’s go on.

Yulia Shvidkaya: Yulia Shvidkaya, co-pilot with Aeroflot Airlines.

Good afternoon, Mr President.

I have a question about the current situation. The thing is that there are so many rumours about the possibility of martial law, the enlistment of volunteers, the call-up of reservists, and that the new conscripts will be sent to Ukraine.

Can you tell us precisely if martial law will be declared and if conscripts will be sent to Ukraine?

Vladimir Putin: Much of what is taking place now, of what we can see and what we come up against are methods of fighting Russia. Incidentally, the sanctions that are imposed on us are like a war. Thankfully, it has not got to that yet.

I think that our so-called partners understand what this can lead to and how much is at stake, despite their reckless statements, for example, like the statement made by the UK Foreign Secretary, when she blurted out that NATO could get involved in the conflict. And we immediately had to take a decision to put our deterrence forces on high alert.

Their reaction was instantaneous: they said that it was a misunderstanding. But nobody rebuffed her (the UK Foreign Secretary is a woman), and nobody has disavowed those statements. They could have told us something like, “You know, it’s her personal opinion, take no notice.” But nobody uttered a single word! What should we think about this? How should we regard it? Of course, we took that statement as a warning and acted accordingly.

And now I will answer your question about volunteers, conscripts, martial law and the like. Under the law, martial law is declared by a Presidential executive order, which should be approved by the Federation Council, in case of foreign aggression, in particular, in the zones of hostilities.

This is not the case now, and I hope it will not come to that. This is the first point.

Second, about the state of alert. There are several options: martial law or the state of alert, which is also declared by a presidential executive order and approved by the Federation Council in case of large-scale internal threats.

There is also the state of emergency. It is usually declared in a specific region or throughout the country in the event of manmade disasters, natural disasters, etc. Thankfully, this is not the case either.

We are not planning to declare a state of alert on the territory of the Russian Federation. There are no such plans and no necessity for this now.

Yes, we see that attempts are being made to stir up our society. Incidentally, this is further proof of what I have said – that we are dealing not with ordinary radicals but with neo-Nazis. Our people can freely express their opinions of what they like or do not like about our actions in Ukraine. But in Ukraine those who express views such as members of the so-called liberal part of our society do are grabbed on the street and shot. We have proof of that. Our security services are collecting this information and will provide it later on. They are simply shot dead. In our country, some of our liberal intellectuals hold protest rallies, but those who say similar things about Russia in Ukraine are simply executed straightaway, without charge or trial.

Now, about the martial law. To reiterate, it is usually imposed in case of an external aggression, a military threat. I hope this will not happen, despite irresponsible statements by certain officials.

We are hearing voices that a no-fly zone should be imposed over Ukraine. It is impossible to do this in Ukraine. It can only be done from the territory of neighbouring states. However, we will consider any move in this direction as participation in the armed conflict of the country from whoseterritory a threat to our servicemen is created. We will consider them participants in hostilities that very second. Their membership in any organisation will not matter then. So, I hope the understanding of this is there and it will not come to this, either.

Only professional servicemen – officers and contract soldiers – are taking part in this operation. There are no conscripts, and we are not planning to get them involved. To reiterate, only men who made a very responsible voluntary choice to take part in this operation and to defend their Motherland are participating in this operation. They are carrying out this mission honourably. In my answer to your first question, I provided the reason why this is so and why we are entitled to say this.

The same applies to those who are called up to the training camps. We do not plan to do this with this category, either. They are regularly called up to training camps. They were called up before and they will be called up afterwards. But we are not going to have this category participate in this conflict, in this operation. We have enough forces and means to address the tasks that we have set for ourselves with the use of the professional army.

By the way, speaking of the operation itself I know there are many speculations about it. Frankly, I have no time to get into that, but they report to me that there is much chitchat about what is going on. All analysts are seeing what is happening, so I will not reveal any secret to you. We could have acted in a variety of ways. We could simply (by the way, this answers your question, in part) help the republics of Donbass right on the line of contact, at the frontline, so to say, and simply reinforce them with our army. But in this case, the other side, I mean reckless support for nationalists and radicals coming from the West, would have provided endless support with the material resources, ammunition, equipment, and so on.

Therefore, our General Staff and the Defence Ministry took a different road. The first thing they did was destroy all the military infrastructure. Not completely but most of it: arms and ammunition depots, aircraft and air defence systems. Destroying air defence systems takes some time (you are civilians, yet you are connected with aviation) – they must be identified and then hit. This work has been practically finished. Hence the demand to impose a no-fly zone. However, doing so would have tremendous and disastrous consequences not only for Europe but also globally. I think those on the other side who are not completely at sea understand that.

That is why we chose that road, and it turned out to be absolutely correct. Our servicemen are working without haste and are doing everything to ensure the safety of civilians. Unfortunately, those bandits, neo-Nazis do not spare people. They shoot dead even their own service personnel who do not want to offer armed resistance. We know about such facts, too. Nationalists, Banderites, neo-Nazis – it is hard to call them anything else – shoot their own servicemen. These nationalists were put in nearly every military unit, up to several dozen in each, and they act in exactly that cruel way.

But I repeat that we are not engaging and are not going to engage conscripts or reservists in this military operation. I presume that our army will fulfil all the tasks it is facing, and I do not have the slightest doubt about that. The very course of the operation proves that. It is going according to schedule, and everything is being done according to the General Staff’s plan.

As for volunteers and those young people who come to military recruiting stations, we are grateful to them for this patriotic impulse and the desire to support the country and the Armed Forces. The very fact of their coming does matters, for sure. However, their assistance is not needed for now, and I believe it will not be needed.

I am turning to the cameras so that they will see and hear me say, “Thank you.”

Let us proceed.

Kristina Shaposhnikova: Good afternoon, Mr President,

Kristina Shaposhnikova, Aeroflot Airbus A320 pilot.

This question may be of concern to many people: given the economic circumstances, are any measures being taken or planned to support families and socially vulnerable groups, as well as public-sector employees? Probably, many are also interested in whether the private sector will receive any support, since it provides employment and pays salaries.

Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: First, we will adjust the social benefits as planned. Pensions and all social benefits will be adjusted.

With regard to the private sector, given the current circumstances, I believe the only way forward is to provide maximum economic freedom to those in business.

We have adopted several decisions in this respect, and the Government is working to expand the list of these support measures. It also includes lifting various restrictions on entrepreneurial activities, in part concerning liberalisation of criminal legislation.

For example, I support the idea – as a matter of fact, this decision has already been adopted – of removing the threat of criminal prosecution for economic crimes, especially if the damage has been paid for. This is my first point.

Second, with regard to tax crimes, indeed, breaking the law is unacceptable, but we agreed that criminal cases in this respect can only be initiated based on materials submitted by the taxation service. We will certainly do this, and we will go down this path.

This is extremely important for people in business. People are aware of it. Frankly, the private sector has been raising these questions for a long time now. I think they will appreciate it accordingly when they hear it.

You had a second question. I jotted it down, but my notes are illegible.

Kristina Shaposhnikova: The question was about supporting families.

Vladimir Putin: Look, we have developed an entire system to support families, especially families with children. We pay benefits for infants to 18 months, then from 18 months to 3 years, and from 3 to 7 years, as well as expectant mothers. Pregnant women facing financial hardship are also supported. Also, support is provided to families with children and single-parent families with children from 8 to 18. Our goal is to develop a single system. Some regions provide support for children 8 to 18, others do not. A federal system is not available yet, either.

Our goal is to develop a unified, clear and harmonious support system for expectant mothers and all children under 18 years of age. We have drafted a plan to do this. Trust me, I discussed this matter with the Government – the social bloc, the Finance Ministry and the Executive Office – this morning. Appropriate measures are being developed – I do not want to get ahead of myself – but I will announce our next steps in building this coordinated system soon.

We will definitely go down this road and put in place a system for supporting families from pregnancy and the birth of a baby to 18 years of age. We will announce the decisions and the steps to be taken along this path soon.

Kristina Shaposhnikova: Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Go ahead, please.

Viktoria Karptsova: Good afternoon, Mr President.

My name is Viktoria Karptsova. I am a flight attendant with Aeroflot Airlines.

Here is the question I wanted to ask you. The aviation industry has been facing challenges ever since the onset of the pandemic around the world. The number of flights decreased, but in early 2022 there was hope that we would be flying as much as we used to. However, one country after another has closed its airspace to Russian carriers, as we have been learning from the news. Of course, this is a double-edged sword. For example, how can people now fly from London to Tokyo? What a complex issue. Of course, this happened before, back in the Soviet days. However, I wanted to know how long you believe this situation will last?

Vladimir Putin: You see, Viktoria, this does not depend just on us. This depends on those who are doing this. They are hurting themselves. I do not think that they like what they are doing. Their authorities are exerting political pressure on them to take these actions.

Without the trans-Siberian overflights you are referring to, they will have to fly around Siberia, since we are closing our air space to them, meaning that they will need more time to reach their destinations, spend more fuel, which in turn will drive up airfares, and so forth.

I proceed from the premise that this sector will evolve with the overall situation.

As for the pandemic you mentioned, domestic air traffic decreased by 88 percent during the pandemic, while foreign flights were down by 90 percent, with almost all flights cancelled. Overall, we have some experience in dealing with situations like this. That said, last year domestic passenger traffic increased 20 percent compared to the pre-pandemic level. I may not have the exact numbers, but I think passenger traffic reached 87.5 million, which is 20 percent higher than pre-pandemic.

What will we do now? Of course, we will seek to increase domestic traffic. We will operate foreign destinations where they remain open, and we will try to change the situation.

You know, there is of course a negative side to all this, since it creates inconveniences for passengers. Still, there are also advantages in terms of infrastructure development here at home. We will develop the domestic aviation industry, build our own aircraft, including the MC-21, the Il-114–300, Baikal, etc.

We will keep developing our airfields and airports. There is an entire programme for developing the airfield network. I think it includes 57 airfields and 60 various initiatives. What are they? They deal with improving infrastructure in all its aspects, building new runways and so forth. This is what improving the “country’s territorial connectivity” is all about.

There is a lot to be done, but this will be yet another development driver, including in terms of industrial and infrastructure development, just as we created an impetus to develop the agricultural sector some time ago. I think last year we made US$25 billion from agricultural exports. This seemed impossible only a short while ago, but we did it. This is not just about the volume of these exports. We have been able to fully cover the country’s needs in terms of staple food. In this regard, we can say that this was a blessing in disguise, as the saying goes. Make no mistake, we will do the same with aircraft manufacturing and passenger transport.

Yulia Vasilevskaya: Good afternoon, Mr President.

Yulia Vasilevskaya, Aeroflot pilot.

I will start by mentioning the widely popular MC-21 aircraft. It is definitely good, and not in the least inferior to foreign analogues in terms of technical or any other properties. At the same time, the company will not be able to replace Boeing and Airbus overnight. As an Airbus pilot, I am worried about the future of our fleet.

In this regard, I have the following question: how will the aviation industry be operating in the near future when leasing companies want to take our aircraft? I am also concerned about the procurement of important spare parts for the timely maintenance and repair of aircraft in our fleet.

Thanks.

Vladimir Putin: First, there is something I need to establish. You noted that the MC-21 is not inferior to its Western counterparts. It is better in many respects, really better: it has a wider body, more space for middle seat, there is more space for luggage compartments – it is definitely better.

By the way, over the past few years, I believe our competitors, including American ones, have made some really unscrupulous moves. They actually included certain materials – which have nothing to do with the defence industry, they are formally double-purpose, but they have never been used for any double purpose – they included some of those materials on their sanctions lists. Why? Because they had their own products, their aircraft that were clearly inferior to the MC-21 in competitive terms.

We ended up making what they tried to strip us of – we invented our own innovative materials, and they are even better than foreign-made ones. Unfortunately, this led to a slight shift to the right, as they say referring to schedules, that is, our country was behind by about twelve to eighteen months in this respect. But we did it.

We will do the same in other areas. You know the saying: they won’t lock the barn door till after the horse is stolen. This is definitely about us. When we are cornered, we start sweating and achieve what we need to. It was the same with the M-C21. It has a PD-14 engine. Not only is it not inferior [to foreign ones], but it is actually better in many respects. Yes, it will take some more time, a few months, and the aircraft will be propelled by Russian-made engines, and it will be cutting-edge and fully Russian-made.

Leasing companies and spare parts – I am not going to go into detail right now, but your former CEO, now Minister of Transport, has some ideas, and he reports them to me regularly, calls me almost every morning. On the whole, I support these considerations. Let's give him the opportunity to negotiate with his partners. I hope they will agree on things that overlap with their own interests. But I am certain that we will fly.

Yulia Vasilevskaya: Thank you.

Vladimir Putin: Do you want to add anything? Go ahead, please.

Natalya Gorbunova: Natalya Gorbunova, Aeroflot flight attendant.

Mr President, now, in this situation, we would really like to help both the country and our industry. We must have more domestic flights. Can you please tell us about the development of regional aviation in the next few years?

Vladimir Putin: You know, and I have already mentioned, that one of our priority goals is to create territorial connections inside the country in several areas. First, this includes domestic airliners starting with the L-410; Il-114–300 with 60 or, I think, 62 seats, and the MC-21. Masha and I have just been to the Sukhoi Superjet-100 cockpit simulator. We will develop all of these. If domestic sourcing for some of them is not complete we will achieve it by any means. This is the first point.

The second component is airports. After all, to fly it is necessary to take off and land. So, we have an extensive programme in this respect and it is underway. By the way, a dozen projects have already been finished, such as modernisation and construction of new runways. We will implement this programme and go further along this road.

A third point – we will, of course, continue subsidising some flights. This includes the Far East and the company operating there – Aurora. This year we have increased subsidies on these routes by five times to 6 billion rubles and will increase it further, if necessary.

So, we will try to avoid situations where people have to fly from one small town to another via Moscow. This is our number one goal. We will work on this consistently, but without haste, and we will certainly resolve it.

Anything else? Go ahead, please.

Galina Kairova: Good afternoon, Mr President.

I am Galina Kairova, an Aeroflot flight training pilot.

All of us were strongly affected by the pandemic. But our aviation has withstood this test and last year domestic air flights even exceeded 2019 levels.

Vladimir Putin: Yes, I said that.

Galina Kairova: And, this was partly due to state support.

Vladimir Putin: Plus 20 percent

Galina Kairova: Yes, this is a lot and enough.

What can we expect now? What should we do next? And how will the state support our industry?

Vladimir Putin: We are starting to go around in circles a bit. I basically already replied to this but will say it again. I have just talked about subsidising these flights, including to the Far East and other areas. We will increase this support and we have already increased it five-fold. We will develop transport infrastructure and manufacture our own aircraft. And, of course we will do all we can to have proper connections between the regions in our country so our people can see it.

It is not just our people that need this, although it is a priority for the economy. This is not just about the transport business but it also concerns the businesspeople you were worried about. It is important to depart and arrive on time. I know when major projects are discussed, specialists always want to know whether they can quickly get to their destination and quickly make it back to Moscow, St Petersburg, Kazan or other large cities to resolve some business issues or simply return to their families if they were in the North. So, we will move forward in all of these directions.

I would like to wish you a happy holiday once again and wish you all the best.","Putin warned on March 5 against the establishment of a no-fly zone. This would have “tremendous
and disastrous consequences” – “not only for Europe but also globally.” Russia would consider the

Ukraine was trying to obtain nuclear weapons and still had relevant capabilities from Soviet times. He

conflict had “not got” to a hot war “yet.” Putin explained that Russia’s “so-called partners” understood
what a NFZ “could lead to” and how much was at stake, “despite their reckless statements, for example, like the statement made by the UK Foreign Secretary, when she blurted out that NATO could get

It is already the 14th day of our defense. The 14th day of our unity. Truly all-Ukrainian. The scale of the threat to the state is maximum. The invasion contingent has already brought into our territory almost everyone who was gathered to invade Ukraine. But the scale of our answer is maximum as well. And these are two different words ""maximum"". 

They have only equipment. At the maximum. We have our people in addition to the equipment. Up to the mark. They only have orders. To attack, to kill, to abuse. And we have a real desire of millions of Ukrainians to win. Defend ourselves. Clear our state...

And on the renewed land

There will be no enemy, adversary,

And there will be a son, and there will be a mother,

And there will be people on the land.

Today is Taras Shevchenko's birthday. This is our old dream. It is his dream to clean the land. And it is alive! And quite real.

Ukrainians!

Everything is in our hands! We withstood and inspired the whole world with our determination. There is no such place on earth where they are not aware of the heroism with which the Ukrainian people defend our beautiful land. Even where we are not supported, they know well what we have achieved. And they feel what else we will achieve if we save the country. If we maintain unity. National force. If we continue to respond wisely and boldly to the activity of the enemy who can destroy the walls of our homes, our schools, our churches, who can destroy Ukrainian enterprises, but will never reach our soul, our heart, our ability to live freely and fight boldly.

Our military and territorial defense units managed to replenish the arsenal of our equipment due to the many trophies they took on the battlefield. Enemy tanks, armored vehicles, ammunition will now work for our defense. For our lives. For our country. What could be more humiliating for the invaders? We will beat the enemy with his own weapons. In addition to ours, which the Russian troops have already felt well, so that more and more enemy soldiers and commanders are asking themselves a simple question: why were they sent to this foreign land, to this war? And we have no answer. Except for one word - death.

Russian soldiers!

You still have a chance to survive. Almost two weeks of our resistance have shown you that we will not give up. Because this is our home. These are our families and children. We will fight until we regain our land and take revenge for all our killed people. For the killed children. You can still be saved if you just leave. Do not believe your commanders when they tell you that you still have a chance in Ukraine. Nothing is waiting for you here. Except for captivity, except for death. You take our lives and give yours. And we know - we have communications interception - that your commanders already understand everything.

This war must be ended. We must return to peace. Leave our home, go back to yours.

14 days of a full-scale brutal war. Terror against our people.

Destruction of cities, blockade of entire districts, constant bombing... 14 days of absence of a vital decision. Not our decision! We would make that decision in hours if we had to help our friends.

From the first day of the Russian invasion, Ukraine has been repeating to its partners that if you do not close the sky, you will also be responsible for this catastrophe, a large-scale humanitarian catastrophe.

Russia uses missiles, aircraft, helicopters against us, against civilians, against our cities, against our infrastructure. This is the world's humanitarian duty to respond. But... There is no decision.

We are grateful to Poland for the alternative - for its readiness to provide Ukraine with combat aircraft. The problem is in logistics. In fact, it is a technical issue. It must be solved! Immediately.

There is an official decision of Poland to transfer the planes to the relevant base - the American base. We also have confirmation - we have all heard - that the agreement between the American party and Poland has been reached. But at the same time we hear that Poland's proposal is allegedly unfounded. And that's what they say in Washington. We also read this. So when will the decision be made? Listen: we have a war! We do not have time for all these signals. This is not ping pong! This is about human lives! We ask once again: solve it faster. Do not shift the responsibility, send us planes.

Yesterday we finally managed to organize a humanitarian corridor. From the city of Sumy to Poltava. 1,600 students and 3,500 residents were rescued. Evacuation of people from cities and towns of the Kyiv region continues. More than 18,000 people have already been rescued from Dymer, Vorzel and Irpin. Today we will do everything to continue the functioning of humanitarian corridors. Sumy - Poltava. Izyum - Lozova. Enerhodar - Zaporizhzhia. Mariupol - Zaporizhzhia. Vorzel, Bucha, Borodyanka, Hostomel to Kyiv. Our government officials are working on this, our servicemen have created all the conditions. If there is at least one shot, full responsibility lies with the invaders.

And you have already seen the world’s response. Powerful. Sanction packages.

In the morning I spoke with Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. We have full understanding. Full support. Our delegation returned from Belarus last night, from negotiations. I will listen to their report. We will prepare for the next rounds of talks. For the sake of Ukraine. For peace.

And finally. Concerning our unity. This is our strength. This is what is needed at this time. We are receiving a lot of signals that someone in Ukraine has decided that he or she may not fight anymore together with everyone. And tries somehow separately, for something personal, for some personal benefit...

We are receiving various signals that some politicians are looking for threads to Russia again.

And some others are again working for a split, contrary to unity.

I want to say one thing and only once: I see what you are doing. If I hear another signal, the answer will be quick. As befits wartime.

Thank God, our people have already sorted everything and everyone out.

Glory to Ukraine!","Also on March 8, the US House of Representatives Select Intelligence Committee held a hearing to assess Russia’s nuclear threats. At that hearing, Avril Haines, the Director of National Intelligence,
stated that Russia had probably underestimated the international response to the invasion of
Ukraine. Still, Putin was unlikely to be deterred by such blowback. Instead, he might escalate further
to force a disarmament of Ukraine and its neutrality, and to prevent Kyiv from moving any closer to
the United States or to NATO. The US intelligence community assessed that Putin perceived the West
as not respecting him enough. The Russian president probably thought he could not afford to lose this
war, Haines said. What kind of victory he was willing to accept might change over time, due to the
war’s significant costs, she noted.
Putin’s nuclear saber rattling fit this assessment very well, Haines added. Nonetheless, the public announcement of a heightened alert of Russian deterrent forces was highly unusual. The United States had not seen such public pronouncements since the 1960s, Haines pointed out. But the US intelligence community had not observed any specific adjustments in Russia’s nuclear forces, going beyond
what had occurred in previous moments of heightened tensions in recent decades. Putin’s nuclear
threatening gestures were likely intended to discourage the West from providing additional support
to Ukraine, Haines said. Putin was probably still confident that Russia could defeat Ukraine and
wanted to prevent Western support that could tip the balance and force a conflict with NATO, she
concluded","Haines: No changes of the Russian nuclear posture, Putin wants to deter Western support for Ukraine.

We believe the most effective way to support the Ukrainian military in their fight against Russia is to provide increased amounts of anti-tank weapons and air defense systems, which is on-going with the international community. The Ukrainians are making excellent use of these weapons now. Although Russian air capabilities are significant, their effectiveness remains limited due to Ukrainian strategic, operational, and tactical ground-based air defense systems...SAMs and MANPADS. 

USEUCOM assesses the military usefulness of additional fixed wing air to Ukraine will be high-risk and low gain. 

The transfer of MiG-29 aircraft will not appreciably increase the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force. The Ukrainian Air Force currently possesses numerous mission capable aircraft that are flying daily. Adding aircraft to the Ukrainian inventory is unlikely to change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force relative to Russian capabilities. Therefore, we assess that the overall gain is low. 

Lastly, the intelligence community assesses the transfer of MiG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in Russian escalation with NATO...producing a high risk scenario. USEUCOM thanks our Polish Allies for their outstanding support and cooperation.  EUCOM will continue to evaluate ways to best support and assist our Ukraine friends. However, in the near-term, and based on this assessment, USEUCOM has no plans to facilitate an indirect, or third party transfer of Polish aircraft.  ","The Commander of the United States European Command Tod Wolters indeed expressed such escalation concerns on March 10. MiGs would “not appreciably increase the effectiveness of the Ukrainian Air Force” as it already owned “numerous mission capable aircraft” that were “flying daily.” And:
The US intelligence community assessed that the transfer could be “mistaken as escalatory and could
result in Russian escalation with NATO,” which would produce “a high risk scenario.”"," Wolters: MiGs could be “mistaken as escalatory and could result in Russian escalation with NATO.”

2022-03-11,"Look, folks, let me begin by saying that when I ran — and a lot of you helped me; a lot of good people ran — I made it clear I was running for three reasons, and — because I had no intention of running for office again when I left the vice presidency.  But when I saw those folks come out of those fields down in Charlottesville, carrying torches and singing Nazi slogans and carrying swastikas, and white supremacists, I decided to get engaged. 

The point is this: I had a message, which I didn’t consult with anybody about generating, to begin with, which was not viewed as being very saleable.  The first was that I thought it was essential to literally restore the soul of this country — a sense of decency and honor, a sense of — a sense that you could trust one another — just restore the soul of the country, because what we were seeing was not who we are.  And among some of our Republicans, what they’re saying is still not who we are.

The second thing I wanted to do that has been the essence of my whole career, from the time I ran 20 miles from here — a 29-year-old kid for the Senate — was that I wanted to rebuild the backbone of the country.  And the backbone of the country is the working class and middle class.  I’m so sick and tired of trickle-down.  When the middle class does well, the poor have a way up and the wealthy do just fine.  They do just fine.  

And third thing, which a lot of you didn’t like — I know — I thought we had to unify the country, because, ultimately, we are a democracy.  And there needs to be — for it to work, there has to be consensus.  In a consensus, you got to get a majority.  We’ve not been able to do that for a lot of the important things.  That’s why we have to continue to maintain our majority. 

This off-year election, in my view, may be the most important off-year election in modern history.  Because we know what happens: We know the fundamental change that shifts if we lose the House and the Senate.  The only thing I’ll have then is a veto pen. 

And so, folks, I want to thank Nancy for the introduction, for your friendship all these years, Nance.  And, Paul, thank you as well. 

And I want to thank — the extraordinary job you’ve done delivering the omnibus, just like you delivered so many critical pieces of legislation last year.

And Hakeem and Steny and Jim and Emanuel Cleaver and Pete, Congresswoman Katherine Clark and all of you out there: Let me first say that — I want to say thank you — thank you for the support you’ve provided Ukraine.  

I was on the phone today for a better part of an hour with — with Zelenskyy, who I speak to almost daily.  The people of Ukraine have demonstrated a remarkable source of bravery and courage.  But the security assistance that you’ve provided has been absolutely critical — critical in their defense. 

Second, I want to thank you for showing a unified front to the world.  When Putin unleashed his assault, he thought he could divide NATO.  He thought he could literally divide this country, the West — the United States — in terms of the parties.  I know a former ambassador knows that out there.  He thought he could divide Democrats and Republicans at home.  But he failed.  He failed. 

For months, the United States has worked tirelessly to keep our Allies and partners together.  As our former ambassador — who you see on television a lot, thank God — will tell you I’ve spent literally hours and hours and hours and hours keeping the Alliance together — the EU, NATO, and all of our allies, including our Asian allies. 

As a result, we’ve been able to ramp up our economic pressure on Putin and further isolate Russia on the global stage.

This morning, along with the G7 nations — in Germany, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom — we moved — which I know you wanted to do initially — and Nancy, I drove her crazy — on most-favored-nation status — as we call it in the United States, “permanent normal trade relations” — and eliminate them.  (Applause.)

But, folks, I know I’ve occasionally frustrated you, but more important than us moving when we want to is making sure all of NATO is together — is together.  They have different vulnerabilities than we do.  Just like in the oil embargo, a lot of them could not — the only way I was — it took, I think, you know, weeks to work out.  I said, “We’re going to block oil — Russian oil energy and energy.” 

We consume 15 percent of it; they rely totally on it.  Without Russian oil, they’re going to find themselves in a position where they get choked off in a way that far exceeds anything we do — anything we do.  

So it took a long time sitting with my counterparts and saying, “Look, we’re going to block oil, but I’m not going to ask you to do it.  I’m going to say to you, ‘You do what you can.  I’m going to explain why it’s not rational for you to do the same thing.  In the meantime, we’re going to help you get energy through liquefied natural gas and a whole range of other things.’”

The point is: Revoking PNTR for Russia has made it harder for Russia to do business with the United States.  But in doing it with unison with our Allies that, kept together, make up half the global economy — half of it — is a crushing blow to Russia. 

Along with our partners and Allies, we’ve stepped up pressure on corrupt Russian billionaires.  We’re increasing — we’re increasing coordination among the G7 countries and — to target, capture the ill-begotten gains — the yachts.  You see some of these yachts — 450 feet long.  No, I’m serious.  Hundreds of millions of dollars in value.  Their luxury apartments. 

The totality of our economic sanctions and export controls are crushing — crushing the Russian economy.  The ruble has lost — and I know many of you know this in detail — lost more than half its value.  You know what the value of a ruble is versus a dollar?  You need 200 rubles to equal 1 dollar today — 200. 

The Moscow stock exchange is closed for a simple reason.  I get asked, “Well, why is it closed?”  Because — for the last two weeks — because the moment it opens, it will be disbanded.  You hear me?  It will blow up.

Credit-rating agencies have downgraded Russia’s government to “junk” status — “junk” status.  And the list of private businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing day by day by day.

I want to be clear though: We’re going to make sure Ukraine has the weapons to defend themselves from invading Russian force.  (Applause.)  And we will send money and food aid to save Euro- — Ukrainian lives.

We’re going to welcome Ukrainian refugees with open arms if, in fact, they come all the way here.  (Applause.)  And as we provide — as we provide this support to Ukraine, we’re going to continue to stand together with our allies in Europe and send an unmistakable message that we will defend every inch of NATO territory –- every single inch — with a united, galvanized NATO.  One movement.  

That’s why I’ve moved over 12,000 American forces along the borders with Russia — Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, et cetera — because they move once.  Granted, if we respond, it is World War Three, but we have a sacred obligation on NATO territory — a sacred obligation — Article 5.  And we will not — although we will not fight the third World War in Ukraine.  Putin’s war against Ukraine is never going to be a victory.  

Democrats [Democracies] are rising to meet the moment, relying — rallying the world on the side of peace and security.  We are showing a strength, and we’ll never falter.  

But, look, the idea — the idea that we’re going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with American pilots and American crews, just understand — and don’t kid yourself, no matter what you all say — that’s called “World War Three.”  Okay?  Let’s get it straight here, guys.  That old expression — “Don’t kid a kidder.”","On the same day, Biden also stressed that while the United States would “defend every inch of NATO
territory with the full might of a united and galvanized NATO,” Washington would “not fight a war
against Russia in Ukraine.” The reason: “A direct confrontation between NATO and Russia is World
War III. And something we must strive to prevent.”86 The United States had a “sacred obligation on
NATO territory — a sacred obligation — Article 5,” but Washington would “not fight the third World
War in Ukraine,” Biden added at a political event.87"," Biden: NATO will be defended, but a direct confrontation with
Russia – a third world war – has to be avoided.

2022-03-15,"This cannot be an unarmed mission,"" Vice Premier Jaroslaw Kaczynski was quoted as saying by the Polish news agency PAP during a visit to Kyiv.

""It must seek to provide humanitarian and peaceful aid to Ukraine.""

Kaczynski, along with the Polish, Czech and Slovenian prime ministers, met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Prime Minister Denys Shmygal.

It is the first visit to Kyiv by foreign leaders since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on February 24.

""I think that we need a peacekeeping mission from NATO, or even possibly from a larger international structure, but a mission that will be able to defend itself and that will operate on Ukrainian territory, which will be in this country with the agreement of the president and the government of Ukraine and it will not be a defenceless mission,"" Kaczynski said.

It ""will strive for peace, to provide humanitarian aid, but at the same time it will be protected by appropriate forces, armed forces,"" added Kaczynski, who is also the leader of the ruling conservative party in Poland and is considered the main strategist of government policy.

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki again called on the EU to ""very quickly give Ukraine candidate status"" and added: ""We will try to organise defensive weapons"".

The three prime ministers, and Kaczynski, went to Kyiv to ""confirm the unequivocal support of the entire European Union for the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine and to present a broad package of support for the Ukrainian state and society,"" said a statement posted on the Polish government's website.

Shortly after their arrival, Ukraine's deputy prime minister Shmygal praised ""the courage of the true friends of Ukraine"".

The European leaders travelled to Kyiv as Russian forces attempt to besiege the Ukrainian capital, which has been put under curfew, and their strikes hit some neighbourhoods.

While the three heads of government are members of the European Council and therefore its representatives, they do not have an official mandate from the council, according to a European source in Brussels.","
In this context, Kaczyński made a renewed push for direct Western support for Ukraine, calling for “a
peacekeeping mission from NATO, or even possibly from a larger international structure, but a mission that will be able to defend itself and that will operate on Ukrainian territory.”

2022-03-16,"We addressed our support for Ukraine;
the severe costs we are imposing on Russia;
and NATO’s work to strengthen our defences, 
now and for the years to come. 
Our close partners Finland, Sweden, and Georgia, and the European Union joined us for the first session.

And Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov described in stark terms the death and destruction caused by president Putin’s war, the determined resistance of the Ukrainians against the invasion and the importance of our continued support. 

We all paid tribute to the courage of the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian armed forces. 

NATO Allies and partners have supported Ukraine with equipment and training for many years.  
We are helping Ukraine to uphold its fundamental right to self-defence, freedom, and democracy with significant amount of critical military equipment.

Today, ministers agreed that we must continue to provide significant support to Ukraine. 

Including with military supplies, financial help, and humanitarian aid.

NATO Allies and partners are also hosting millions of Ukrainian refugees.

President Putin must stop the war. Immediately.
Withdraw his forces. 
Now. 
And engage in diplomacy.  
In good faith.

NATO is responding to this crisis with speed and unity.
And next week, Allied Heads of State and Government will meet for an extraordinary NATO Summit.

We will address both our immediate response.
And the changes we need to make for our longer-term security.

Moscow should be in no doubt.
NATO will not tolerate any attack on Allied sovereignty or territorial integrity.  

We have already activated our defence plans to shield the Alliance.
Increased our readiness.
And deployed troops from both sides of the Atlantic. 

There are now hundreds of thousands of forces at heightened alert across the Alliance.
One hundred thousand US troops in Europe.
And around 40,000 troops under direct NATO command, mostly in the eastern part of the Alliance. 

Backed by major air and naval power.
As well as air defences.

But we face a new reality for our security.
So we must reset our collective defence and deterrence for the longer term. 

Today we have tasked our military commanders to develop options across all domains. Land, air, sea, cyber and space.

On land, our new posture should include substantially more forces in the eastern part of the Alliance, at higher readiness.
With more prepositioned equipment and supplies.

In the air, more Allied air power.
And strengthened integrated air and missile defence.

At sea, carrier strike groups, submarines and significant numbers of combat ships on a persistent basis.

We will also consider the future of our cyber defences.
And how best to draw on Allied space assets.

We should also train and exercise more often, and in greater numbers. 

Major increases to our deterrence and defence will require major investments.

Allies need to invest a minimum of 2% of GDP on defence.

And I welcome that Allies such as Germany and Denmark have already made important announcements on more investments and faster timetables.  

We also need to spend more together.

NATO common funding is the essential enabler that allows us to work together. 
It is a force multiplier for national defence efforts.
And it shows solidarity as Allies.

At this critical moment for our security, unity between North America and Europe in NATO is more important than ever.

And with that, I am ready to take your questions.

Jonathan Beale (BBC): Thank you, Secretary General. Can I just ask you, we've heard once again from President Zelensky addressing US Congress calling for a no fly zone. Are there any Allies at all who have been asking for one, even if the decision of the Alliance as a whole is not to enforce one?
Has there been any discussion at all about it? And the second question I have is just about Ukraine and its NATO membership. Do you believe that Ukraine has cooled towards its view of joining NATO as a negotiating tool with the hope of eventually reaching some kind of agreement with Russia? Thank you very much.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: Allies are united both in providing support to Ukraine, to support Ukraine to uphold the right for self defence. But Allies are also united when it comes to that NATO should not deploy forces on the ground or in the airspace of Ukraine. Because we have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict, this war, doesn't escalate beyond Ukraine.

We see death, we see destruction, we see human suffering in Ukraine. But this can become even worse if NATO took actions that actually turned this into a full-fledged war between NATO and Russia. So Allies are united when it comes to the issue of how to provide support to Ukraine. Ministers addressed this today, they reinforced the message of the importance of providing support with equipment, advanced equipment, air defence systems, anti-tank weapons and many other types of support, but no NATO deployment of air or ground capabilities in Ukraine and that's the united position from NATO Allies.

Then, the message to Ukraine is the same now as it has been for years: that Ukraine is a sovereign, independent nation. It has its own right to choose its own path, and we respect the decisions made by the democratic elected government by Ukraine. So it's up to them to decide whether they aspire for NATO membership or not. And then it's for 30 Allies to decide on that issue, not for Russia to try to veto such a process.

Natasha Bertrand (CNN): Thank you, Mr Secretary General. I'm wondering whether NATO has invited President Zelensky to participate in any way in the leaders’ summit next week as Reznikov did in the defence ministerial today, and I'm also wondering if you could respond to the Polish proposal to send NATO forces into Ukraine on a so-called peacekeeping mission. Thanks.

NATO Secretary General: What we need is peace in Ukraine and therefore Russia and President Putin has to stop the war and withdraw its forces. We support all efforts to find a negotiated solution. We support all efforts to find a diplomatic solution. And of course, we support and welcome the talks and negotiations which are now taking place between Ukraine and Russia. At the same time, we support Ukraine because we know what they can achieve on the negotiating table is of course very closely linked to the situation on the battlefield. So I strongly also believe that one reason why the Ukrainians also are saying that they have seen some steps in the right direction is because they have been able to fight back. They have been able to fight back against the invading Russian forces.

So the courage, the determination and the support from NATO Allies to the Ukrainian Armed Forces is extremely important also when it comes to what they can achieve as part of a negotiated process with Russia. So again, of course we support peace efforts, we call on Russia and President Putin to withdraw its forces, but we have no plans of deploying NATO troops on the ground in Ukraine.

Marilu Lucrezio (RAI TV): Can you comment on Italy's role in this current crisis? And happy birthday for today!
NATO Secretary General: Thank you. I would very much like to comment on Italy’s role. Italy is a highly valued NATO Ally and a founding member, and Italy is contributing to our collective defence in many different ways. I was recently in Romania, I met Italian pilots, they are helping there to keep NATO airspace safe. And they really show commitment and strength in their contributions to different NATO missions and operations, including in Kosovo, where Italy has been a key Ally for many, many years.

Henry Foy (Financial Times): Thank you. Just a follow up to the question about the peace talks. You said that you're encouraged by signs and that you support any effort to find a diplomatic solution. Could you tell us are you seeing any signs on the ground that the Russians are genuine in their approach to these peace talks? Or that they may well just be using them as a distraction for resupply and for restructuring their approach? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: On the ground, we don't see any sign and that's the reason why we also call on Russia to engage in these talks in good faith. And it's not for me to report from these talks, NATO are not part of those talks. These are talks between Ukraine and Russia. But I'll just see in the reports coming out from those talks, I think it's very important not to speculate and not to pre-judge or to pre-empt any outcome of these talks. But my message was in a way that it is obvious that what Ukraine can achieve around the negotiating table is very closely linked to the situation on the battleground. And therefore the support we give to them to stand up against and to resist the Russian invasion also helps them to achieve an acceptable outcome in the negotiations.

Lorne Cook (AP): Could you tell me a little bit more about the tasking that you've given NATO commanders, what that might involve and are we looking ahead one year or are we talking about a decade, something longer term? And you also use the word persistent, I wonder what that means? Why wouldn't you say permanent, on a permanent basis?

NATO Secretary General: This is the way we make these kinds of decisions in NATO is that the politicians, they set out the guidelines, the direction, then we task our military commanders to give advice on how to follow up, and then we make final decisions as politicians based on this advice and input from our military commanders.

This was exactly the same we did back in 2016 when we had the Warsaw summit and made historic decisions for the first time in our history to deploy NATO combat troops to the eastern part of the Alliance. You have to remember that before Ukraine, also before the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 by Russia, NATO had no combat troops in the eastern part of the Alliance. Then we had the illegal annexation of Crimea. And since 2014, we have implemented the biggest reinforcement of our collective defence since the end of the Cold War, tripling the size of the NATO Response Force, establishing the battle groups in the Baltic countries and Poland, more presence in the air, at sea and of course also started to invest more, increasing defence spending. Then the process was the same: the politicians tasked the commanders, they provided advice and based on that we developed the final conclusions that Allied heads of state and government made at the summit in 2016. And then since then, we have implemented that.

I foresee a similar process now. We have tasked the military commanders, we will have their advice within weeks. And then my ambition is that heads of state and government, when they meet at the end of June, can make the decisions on significantly increased presence, reinforcing our deterrence and defence on land, at sea and in the air. Of course, this will then depend on the input we get from the commanders but also of course, at the end of the day, it has to be a political decision by the leaders. So the decision I foresee within months, meaning by the summit in June, then implementation will of course vary a bit depending on what conversations you're going to make.

Thomas Gutschker (FAZ): Secretary General, is there anything in the NATO Russia Founding Act that could restrict military planners and commanders when they work out these options for leaders? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: We will do what is necessary to make sure that there is no room for misunderstanding in Moscow, for miscalculation in Moscow about our commitment, readiness to protect and defend all allies and every inch of NATO territory. The reason why we do that is not to provoke a conflict, but to prevent a conflict. That has been the success of NATO for more than 70 years; that any potential aggressor or adversary has always known that an attack on one ally will trigger a response from the whole Alliance.

To ensure that, in a new security reality, we need to reset our deterrence and defence. That is exactly what we are now tasking the commanders to provide advice on; how to reset our deterrence and defence and we will do what is necessary. 

The NATO Russia founding Act of course has a clear reference to the current security environment back in 1997. We are not in the current security environment today. We are in a totally different security environment. At that stage we actually foresaw Russia as a strategic partner, working with them. Since then Russia has invaded Georgia, illegally annexed Crimea and also invaded Ukraine. We will do what is necessary and the NATO Russia Founding Act is not something that will create problems or hindrance for NATO to make the necessary decisions.

Dmytro Shkurko (National News Agency of Ukraine): In the negotiations with Russia, there is another important factor. According to data released today, from the General Staff of Ukraine, around 40% of invading forces already lost by Russians in equipment and manpower. Could NATO confirm that? And because of that, we obvious question; is the  threat which Russia poses to NATO in escalation a little bit over estimated by NATO countries? Thank you.

NATO Secretary General: President Putin totally underestimated the strength of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. President Putin underestimated the unity of the Ukrainian people and the courage of the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian leadership. And this, combined with the massive support the Ukrainian Armed Forces are receiving and actually have received from NATO allied countries over many years, have forced President Putin to change his stance and to realise that this quick victory, this blitzkrieg; taking control over Kiev within days, has actually failed.

But we should not underestimate Russia's capabilities when it comes to continue the war and also to continue to attack, including cities. We have seen how Russia has been responsible for the same brutal warfare, both in Chechnya, but also in Syria. Of course, even though they have made severe mistakes, Russia maintain a large capability of conventional armed forces.

President Putin has also, they have also, used nuclear rhetoric. Russia is a nuclear power and we have seen how they have stepped up the nuclear rhetoric threatening both NATO allies and Ukraine. I think we must not underestimate the dangers related to the military capabilities of Russia, including the will to actually use force and impulse devastation and destruction on others.

Ketevan Kardava (IMEDI TV): Mr. Secretary General, can you tell us more about Georgia. Defence Minister from Georgia attended the ministerial and you said recently that it's a good agreement that we need to do more to support Georgia. So, what options were discussed for example today? Thank you very much.

NATO Secretary General: I think we need to realise that we are faced with a totally new security reality, which of course affects the people of Ukraine. It's devastating for them, but it's also putting more pressure on those countries in our neighbourhood who are not members of NATO, not members of EU, countries at risk, and Georgia is one of them.

The Georgian Defence Minister attended the meeting and all of us listened very carefully to his intervention, where he stated the challenges Georgia faces being a country which has already seen the consequences of aggressive actions by Russia back in 2008 and other attempts by Russia to interfere in Georgia in domestic affairs.

One of the lessons we have to learn from what is going on in Ukraine today is that we need to support these countries which are at risk now. It's better to support and help them now than after a military intervention. So if anything, I think we now see the value of the support that has been provided to Ukraine before the invasion, but also the importance of that we could have done even more for Ukraine.

I think that the message for Georgia is that we should step up, provide more support and send the message that we support the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia. Not only words, but also in deeds, and therefore I call on NATO allies and others to provide support to Georgia and that was the message also from allied leaders at the meeting today.

James Bays(Al Jazeera): Secretary General, we're 21 days now into this conflict. Based on Russia's performance militarily so far, and your current intelligence, can Russia win this war?

NATO Secretary General: I think we should all be careful speculating too much. What we have seen is strength, the strength and the courage and the capabilities of the Ukrainian armed forces, which has impressed the whole world. Which has been able to slow down to fight back against the invading Russian forces and I pay tribute to the Ukrainian forces and the Ukrainian people in the way they have been able to stand up against the invasion.

But at the same time, Russia remains a formidable military power. They have many different types of weapons, and therefore I think it's too early to speculate about the outcome. What we need is Russia to stop the war. President Putin to withdraw its troops and then to find a political solution. That's what I would say about that.

Dominika Kosic (POLISH TV): I would like to go back to the special summit of NATO in upcoming week. Could you say what is the special reason to organise the summit, especially since there was a regular NATO Summit in June? So could you tell us more about his thinking?

NATO Secretary General: President Putin has underestimated Ukraine, the people of Ukraine and the armed forces of Ukraine and the political leadership of Ukraine. But President Putin has also underestimated NATO, because we reacted swiftly and unified in a way that has imposed severe costs on Russia. Together with partners; the European Union, NATO allies have imposed unprecedented economic costs. We have provided and continued to provide essential support to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Allies do that every day and we are also increasing the presence of NATO in the eastern part of the Alliance.

President Putin's aim was to divide NATO. What he gets is a more united NATO. He wanted in a way to undermine the nation of Ukraine, he is actually strengthening the unity of Ukraine and the commitment to the Ukrainian nation by the Ukrainian people. And then he wanted less NATO on his borders. He's getting more NATO on his borders.

To do all this, we need to be coordinated. We need to consult and therefore we, the day after the invasion, had a virtual NATO summit with all the NATO leaders, extraordinary NATO Summit, and we will have an extraordinary NATO summit next week, in person here in Brussels. To continue to ensure that we are united, that we are closely aligned and that we act together.

Both when it comes to providing support to Ukraine, when it comes to coordinating our efforts, when it comes to imposing costs on Russia, but also when it comes to taking the necessary decisions to ensure that we send a clear message to Russia about our credible deterrence and defence. Both in the short term but also in the longer term, including by starting the work to reset NATO's deterrence and defence.","In the press conference following the NATO defense ministers’ meeting on March 16, however, there was no mention of the Polish proposal for a peacekeeping mission. Stoltenberg said Allies were united in their support for Ukraine, but they were equally united in saying that “NATO should not deploy forces on the ground or in the airspace of Ukraine.” This is because they “have a responsibility to ensure that this conflict, this war, doesn’t escalate beyond Ukraine.” NATO would “not tolerate any attack on Allied sovereignty or territorial integrity,” he stressed. In this context, Stoltenberg announced a “reset” of the Alliance’s “collective defense and deterrence for the longer term.” Above all, NATO’s eastern flank should be strengthened. Referring to the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, which had ruled out the permanent stationing of NATO troops on the territory of the former Warsaw Pact states, he stressed that today we were in a “totally different security environment.” The Alliance would not let this document “create problems or hindrance for NATO to make the necessary decisions.” In light of Putin’s nuclear threats, Stoltenberg warned, one should “not underestimate the dangers related to the military capabilities of Russia, including the will to actually use force and impulse devastation and destruction on others.” NATO would do everything necessary “to make sure that there is no room for misunderstanding in Moscow, for miscalculation in Moscow about our commitment, readiness to protect and defend all allies and every inch of NATO territory.”In addition, he explained, ministers had decided to provide significant support to Ukraine","NATO decides not to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine but
to expand economic and military assistance.

President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.

Taking part in our meeting are senior Government officials, plenipotentiary presidential envoys in the federal districts and heads of Russian regions.

We are meeting in a complicate period as our Armed Forces are conducting a special military operation in Ukraine and Donbass. I would like to remind you that at the beginning, on the morning of February 24, I publicly announced the reasons for and the main goal of Russia’s actions. It is to help our people in Donbass, who have been subjected to real genocide for nearly eight years in the most barbarous ways, that is, through blockade, large-scale punitive operations, terrorist attacks and constant artillery raids. Their only guilt was that they demanded basic human rights: to live according to their forefathers’ laws and traditions, to speak their native language, and to bring up their children as they want.

During these years, the Kiev authorities have ignored and sabotaged the implementation of the Minsk Package of Measures for a peaceful settlement of the crisis and ultimately late last year openly refused to implement it.

They also started to implement plans to join NATO. Moreover, the Kiev authorities also announced their intention to have nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles. This was a real threat. With foreign technical support, the pro-Nazi Kiev regime would have obtained weapons of mass destruction in the foreseeable future and, of course, would have targeted them against Russia.

There was a network of dozens of laboratories in Ukraine, where military biological programmes were conducted under the guidance and with the financial support of the Pentagon, including experiments with coronavirus strains, anthrax, cholera, African swine fever and other deadly diseases. Frantic attempts are being made to conceal traces of these secret programmes. However, we have grounds to assume that components of biological weapons were being created in direct proximity to Russia on the territory of Ukraine.

Our numerous warnings that such developments posed a direct threat to the security of Russia were rejected with open and cynical arrogance by Ukraine and its US and NATO patrons.

In other words, all our diplomatic efforts were fully in vain. We have been left with no peaceful alternative to settle the problems that developed through no fault of ours. In this situation, we were forced to begin this special military operation.

The movement of Russian forces against Kiev and other Ukrainian cities is not connected with a desire to occupy that country. This is not our goal, as I pointed out openly in my statement on February 24.

As for the combat tactics drafted by the Defence Ministry of Russia and the General Staff, this has fully justified itself. Our fellows – soldiers and officers – are displaying courage and heroism and are doing all they can to avoid civilian losses in Ukrainian cities.

This is what I would like to say for the first time: at the very start of the operation in Donbass, the Kiev authorities were offered opportunities to avoid hostilities, via different channels, to simply withdraw their troops from Donbass as an alternative to bloodshed. They did not want to do this. Well, this was their decision; now they will understand what is happening in reality, on the ground.

The operation is being carried out successfully, in strict conformity with the approved plan.

I must note that, encouraged by the United States and other Western countries, Ukraine was purposefully preparing for a scenario of force, a massacre and an ethnic cleansing in Donbass. A massive onslaught on Donbass and later Crimea was just a matter of time. However, our Armed Forces have shattered these plans.

Kiev was not just preparing for war, for aggression against Russia – it was conducting it. There were endless attempts to stage acts of subversion and organise a terrorist underground in Crimea. Hostilities in Donbass and the shelling of peaceful residential areas have continued all these years. Almost 14,000 civilians, including children have been killed over this time.

As you know, there was a missile strike at the centre of Donetsk on March 14. This was an overt bloody act of terror that took over 20 lives. Shelling has been ongoing during the past few days. They are striking randomly at squares with the fervor of fanatics and the exasperation of the doomed. They are acting like the Nazis did when they tried to drag as many innocent victims as they could to their graves.

But what is shocking in its extreme cynicism is not just Kiev’s blatant lies and statements that Russia allegedly launched this missile at Donetsk (they have gone as far as this), but the attitude of the so-called civilised world. The European and American press did not even notice this tragedy in Donetsk, as if nothing happened.

This is how they have been hypocritically looking the other way over the past eight years as mothers buried their children in Donbass, as elderly people were killed. This is simply moral degradation, complete de-humanisation.

It was no longer possible to tolerate this outrageous attitude towards the people of Donbass. To put an end to this genocide, Russia recognized the people’s republics of Donbass and signed treaties of friendship and mutual aid with them. Based on these treaties, the republics appealed to Russia for military aid in rebuffing the aggression. We rendered this aid because we simply could not do otherwise. We had no right to act otherwise.

I would like to emphasise this point and draw your attention to it: if our troops had acted only within the people's republics and helped them liberate their territory, it would not have been a final solution, it would not have led to peace and would not have ultimately removed the threat – to our country, this time to Russia. On the contrary, a new frontline would have been extended around Donbass and its borders, and shelling and provocations would have continued. In other words, this armed conflict would have continued indefinitely. It would have been fuelled by the revanchist hysteria of the Kiev regime, as NATO deployed its military infrastructure faster and more aggressively. In this case, we would have been faced with the fact that the attack, the offensive weapons of the alliance were already at our borders.

I will repeat – we had no alternative for self-defence, for ensuring Russia's security, to this special military operation. We will reach the goals we set. We will certainly ensure the security of Russia and our people and will never allow Ukraine to be a bridgehead for aggressive actions against our country.

We remain ready to discuss matters of fundamental importance to Russia’s future during the talks. This includes Ukraine’s status as a neutral country, and demilitarisation and denazification. Our country has done everything it could to organise and hold these talks realising that it is important to use every opportunity to save people and their lives.

But time and time again we see that the Kiev regime, which its Western handlers have charged with the task of creating an aggressive “anti-Russia” stance, does not care about the future of the people of Ukraine. They do not care that people are dying, that hundreds of thousands, or even millions of people had to flee their homes, and that a horrendous humanitarian disaster is unfolding in the cities controlled by the neo-Nazis and armed criminals who were cut loose.

Clearly, Kiev’s Western patrons are just pushing them to continue the bloodshed. They incessantly supply Kiev with weapons and intelligence, as well as other types of assistance, including military advisers and mercenaries.

They are using economic, financial, trade and other sanctions against Russia as weapons, but these sanctions have backfired in Europe and in the United States where prices of gasoline, energy and food have shot up, and jobs in the industries associated with the Russian market have been cut. So, do not shift the blame on us and do not accuse our country of everything that goes wrong in your countries.

I want ordinary Western people hear me, too. You are being persistently told that your current difficulties are the result of Russia’s hostile actions and that you have to pay for the efforts to counter the alleged Russian threat from your own pockets. All of that is a lie.

The truth is that the problems faced by millions of people in the West are the result of many years of actions by the ruling elite of your respective countries, their mistakes, and short-sighted policies and ambitions. This elite is not thinking about how to improve the lives of their citizens in Western countries. They are obsessed with their own self-serving interests and super profits.

This can be seen in the data provided by international organisations, which clearly show that social problems, even in the leading Western countries, have exacerbated in recent years, that inequality and the gap between the rich and the poor is widening, and racial and ethnic conflicts are making themselves felt. The myth of the Western welfare society, the so-called golden billion, is crumbling.

To reiterate, the whole planet is now paying for the West’s ambitions and the West’s attempts to maintain its elusive dominance by any means possible.

Imposing sanctions is the logical continuation and the distillation of the irresponsible and short-sighted policy of the US and EU countries’ governments and central banks. They themselves have driven up global inflation in recent years, and with their actions caused rising global poverty and greater inequality across the world. The question now arises – who will answer for the millions who will die of hunger in the world’s poorest countries due to growing food shortages?

Let me reiterate, the global economy and global trade as a whole have suffered a major blow, as did trust in the US dollar as the main reserve currency.

The illegitimate freezing of some of the currency reserves of the Bank of Russia marks the end of the reliability of so-called first-class assets. In fact, the US and the EU have defaulted on their obligations to Russia. Now everybody knows that financial reserves can simply be stolen. And many countries in the immediate future may begin – I am sure this is what will happen – to convert their paper and digital assets into real reserves of raw materials, land, food, gold and other real assets which will only result in more shortages in these markets.

Let me add that the seizure of foreign assets and accounts of Russian companies and individuals is also a lesson for domestic businesses that there is nothing as reliable as investing in one’s own country. I personally have said that a number of times.

We appreciate the position of those foreign companies who continue working in our country despite the brazen pressure from the US and its vassals. They are sure to find additional opportunities for growth in the future.

We also know those who cowardly betrayed their partners and forgot about their responsibility to employees and customers in Russia, rushing to earn illusory dividends from joining the anti-Russia campaign. However, unlike Western countries, we will respect property rights.

Here is what I would like to point out. We must clearly understand that a new package of sanctions and restrictions would have been imposed on us no matter what. I want to emphasise this. For the West, our military operation in Ukraine is just a pretext for imposing more sanctions on us. Indeed, this time they are concentrated. In the same way, the West used the referendum in Crimea as a pretext, which, by the way, took place on March 16, 2014, eight years ago today, when the residents of Crimea and Sevastopol made the free choice to be one with their historical homeland.

To reiterate, these are just pretexts. The policy of containing and weakening Russia, including through economic isolation, a blockade, is a premeditated, long-term strategy. Western leaders are no longer hiding the fact that the sanctions are not directed against individuals or companies. Their goal is to deliver a blow to our entire economy, our social and cultural sphere, every family, and every Russian citizen.

In fact, the steps designed to make the lives of millions of people worse have all the attributes of an aggression, a war by economic, political, and informational means, and it is of a comprehensive and blatant nature. Again, the West’s top political circles do not even hesitate to talk about it openly.

The verbal tinsel of political correctness, inviolability of private property and freedom of speech was blown off overnight. Even the Olympic principles were trampled upon. They did not hesitate to settle their score through the Paralympic athletes. So much for “sport being separate from politics.”

In many Western countries, people are subjected to persecution just because they are originally from Russia. They are being denied medical care, their children are expelled from schools, parents are losing their jobs, and Russian music, culture, and literature are being banned. In its attempts to “cancel” Russia, the West tore off its mask of decency and began to act crudely showing its true colours. One cannot help but remember the anti-Semitic Nazi pogroms in Germany in the 1930s, and then pogroms perpetrated by their henchmen in many European countries that joined the Nazi aggression against our country during the Great Patriotic War.

A massive attack against Russia has also been unleashed in cyberspace. An unprecedented information campaign has been launched through global social networks and all Western media outlets, whose impartiality and independence have proved to be a mere myth. Access to information is being restricted and people are being crammed full of all sorts of fake stories, propaganda, and fabrication, or simply put, snake oil. It even got to the point where American social media companies said straight out that it was possible to post calls for the murder of Russian nationals.

We realise what kind of resources this empire of lies has at its disposal but, all the same, when confronted with truth and justice, it is helpless. Russia will never stop trying to make its position clear to the whole world. And our position is honest and open, and an increasing number of people hear, understand and share it.

I want to be as direct as possible: hostile geopolitical designs lie behind the hypocritical talk and recent actions by the so-called collective West. They have no use – simply no use – for a strong and sovereign Russia, and they will not forgive us for our independent policy or for standing up for our national interests.

We still remember how they supported separatism and terrorism by encouraging terrorists and bandits in the North Caucasus. Just like in the 1990s and the early 2000s, they want to try again to finish us off, to reduce us to nothing by turning us into a weak and dependent country, destroying our territorial integrity and dismembering Russia as they see fit. The failed then and they will fail this time.

Yes, of course, they will back the so-called fifth column, national traitors – those who make money here in our country but live over there, and “live” not in the geographical sense of the word but in their minds, in their servile mentality.

I do not in the least condemn those who have villas in Miami or the French Riviera, who cannot make do without foie gras, oysters or gender freedom as they call it. That is not the problem, not at all. The problem, again, is that many of these people are, essentially, over there in their minds and not here with our people and with Russia. In their opinion – in their opinion! – it is a sign of belonging to the superior caste, the superior race. People like this would sell their own mothers just to be allowed to sit on the entry bench of the superior caste. They want to be just like them and imitate them in everything. But they forget or just completely fail to see that even if this so-called superior caste needs them, it needs them as expendable raw material to inflict maximum damage on our people.

The collective West is trying to divide our society using, to its own advantage, combat losses and the socioeconomic consequences of the sanctions, and to provoke civil unrest in Russia and use its fifth column in an attempt to achieve this goal. As I mentioned earlier, their goal is to destroy Russia.

But any nation, and even more so the Russian people, will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and will simply spit them out like an insect in their mouth, spit them onto the pavement. I am convinced that a natural and necessary self-detoxification of society like this would strengthen our country, our solidarity and cohesion and our readiness to respond to any challenge.

The so-called collective West and its fifth column are accustomed to measuring everything and everyone by their own standards. They believe that everything is for sale and everything can be bought, and therefore they think we will break down and back off. But they do not know our history and our people well enough.

Indeed, many countries around the world have long put up with living with their backs bent, obsequiously accepting all the decisions that come from their sovereign, looking up to it subserviently. This is how many countries live. Unfortunately, in Europe, as well.

But Russia will never be seen in such a miserable and humiliated situation, and the fight we are waging is the fight for our sovereignty and the future of our country and our children. We will fight for the right to be and remain Russia. The courage and fortitude of our soldiers and officers, the faithful defenders of the Fatherland, should inspire us.

Colleagues,

Clearly, the ongoing developments are drawing a line under the global dominance of Western countries in politics and the economy. Moreover, they call into question the economic model that has been imposed on the developing countries and the entire world in recent decades.

Importantly, the obsession of the United States and its proponents with the sanctions is not shared by the countries that are home to more than half of the global population. These states represent the fastest growing and the most promising portion of the global economy. That includes Russia.

Indeed, it is difficult for us at the moment. Russian financial companies, major enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses are facing unprecedented pressure.

The banking system was the first to come under sanctions, but our banks dealt with this challenge. They are working literally around the clock to make payments and settlements between individual clients and to ensure the functioning of enterprises.

The second wave of sanctions was designed to set off panic in the area of retail. According to estimates, over the past three weeks, additional demand for goods has exceeded one trillion rubles. However, our manufacturers, suppliers, transport and logistics companies did everything humanly possible to avoid major shortages in retail chains.

I would like to thank the business community and the teams at companies, banks and organisations, which are not only responding effectively to sanction-related challenges but are also laying the foundation for the continued sustainable development of our economy. I would like to make a special mention of the Government, the Bank of Russia, regional governors and regional and municipal teams. In the current tough conditions, you are carrying out your responsibilities admirably.

Obviously, the attempts to organise an economic blitzkrieg against Russia, demoralise our society and push us around have failed, and so we are sure to see attempts to bring even greater pressure to bear on our country. But we will overcome these difficulties as well. The Russian economy will adapt to the new realities. We will strengthen our sovereignty in science and technology, allocate additional resources to support agriculture, the processing industry, infrastructure, and housing, and continue developing foreign trade ties to tap into rapidly growing, dynamic international markets.

Clearly, in the new realities we will have to make deep structural changes in our economy, and I will not pretend that they will be easy or that they will not lead to a temporary increase in inflation and unemployment.

In this situation, our task is to minimise such risks. We must not just meet all the social commitments of the state but also launch new, more effective mechanisms for supporting our people and their incomes.

We will focus on protecting mothers and children and supporting families with children. We have already made a decision – you know about it – to introduce as of April 1 payments for children aged 8 through 16 in low-income families. The size of the payment will range from 50 to 100 percent of the subsistence minimum for every child. Currently the national average is up to 12,300 rubles. Thus, we will have a uniform system of support from when a mother first becomes pregnant until the child turns 17.

I am instructing the Government to oversee the operation of this system so that it quickly detects any changes in the material status of families. That is, it is necessary to make sure families start receiving state support as soon as possible if the parents lost their jobs or faced other difficult circumstances.

I also ask the Government to promptly analyse the efficacy of the measures to support those who have lost their jobs. Such measures must obviously be expanded, through the social contract mechanism, among other.

I am aware that the price hikes are a big blow to people’s incomes, and so we will take action to increase all social payments shortly including benefits and pensions, we will raise the minimum wage and the minimum subsistence level and also the wages of public-sector workers. I ask the Government to calculate the exact parameters for the increases.

To emphasise, even under the current difficult conditions we must reduce poverty and inequality by the end of the year. This issue remains quite solvable even now. I ask the Government and the regions to focus on this task. I will add that we understand that it is not only an economic issue but also one of social justice.

At present, much depends on the lead of the heads of the constituent entities of the Federation and their readiness to assume responsibility. I signed an executive order today on additional powers for heads of regions – they will be authorised to take flexible and responsive decisions to support our citizens, the economy and social policy in light of the situation on the ground. Let me remind you that we streamlined our steps in fighting the coronavirus in exactly this way, making it possible to consider the situation in each region, city and village – and the situation is different everywhere.

I am instructing all the departments of federal bodies in the constituent entities of the Federation to coordinate their work with the regional authorities, and governors must establish operational centres to ensure economic development and to personally lead this work.

What is the priority here?

Private businesses must play the key role in overcoming the current problems as they can quickly rework logistics, find new suppliers and increase output of in-demand products. Supporting employment, incomes and wages and supporting the stable, balanced performance of the economy in general depend on how quickly private businesses will be able to find the right solutions and take them.

That is why we must respond to external pressure with the utmost entrepreneurial freedom and with support for business initiative.

I want the Government, law enforcement agencies and oversight authorities to continue their work on lifting unnecessary administrative and regulatory barriers. Furthermore, it is unacceptable to distract the private sector and regional authorities from addressing the most pressing tasks and burden them with all sorts of inspections and oversight procedures.

The lack of working capital and the unavailability or high cost of loans is among the key problems facing companies now, and the Central Bank was forced to take appropriate measures. In this regard, I am ordering the following steps to be taken.

First, companies that fulfill orders placed by government authorities and companies partly owned by the state should be paid for the delivered goods and services as soon as possible, and reinvest the proceeds into business. In this regard, I propose increasing the amount of advance payments under government contracts. The advance payment must amount to at least a half of the total amount of a contract, and the payment term for the delivered goods and services should be reduced to seven business days. A similar decision must also be made at the level of the constituent entities of the Federation, municipalities and companies with state participation.

Second, it is imperative to improve entrepreneurs’ ability to raise additional resources from development institutions, by which I mean expanding the Project Financing Factory’s activities (it is working well, and we know from practice that its services are in demand), providing resources for business investment plans through the Industry Development Fund (which is one of the really well-performing tools), the Bank for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, and also through regional support institutions, including guarantee funds. I hereby instruct the Government to allocate additional funds to the constituent entities of the Federation to fund these regional tools.

I want the Government and our colleagues in the regions to pay attention to the fact that the most important task is to ensure the availability of goods on the consumer market, primarily essential supplies, medications and medical products. Logistical complications and other objective problems that result in price surges must be resolved quickly. At the same time, it is imperative to rule out intervention in price regulation. The increased supply of goods and nothing else should lead to a decrease and stabilisation of prices.

Separately, I would like to address our exporters. Whenever deliveries to international markets do not run smoothly, you should send extra batches of goods to the domestic market rather than reduce your production rates. This should objectively reduce domestic prices, including those of gasoline, diesel, bitumen, metals, and other export goods. I want the Government and the Federal Antimonopoly Service, as well regional authorities, to monitor these markets at all times.

Furthermore, considering the new challenges faced by Russia, we must maintain and expand our long-term development agenda, including the implementation of all planned federal and regional projects. We must make full use of the potential of our budget system as a tool for stimulation.

As we agreed, federal funding for various projects, including construction projects, will be carried out in full. Moreover, in December we decided on allocating additional funds if construction costs went up for objective reasons.

I consider it important to note that there will be no problems with federal budget funding in the current situation. Our economy is generating adequate revenue. This means we will not have to resort to emissions. In simple terms, the Central bank will not have to print money. We have revenue – sound market revenue. The problem is not rooted in money. Let me repeat that we have the resources. The main difficulties are related to the supply of spare parts, technology and construction materials, and the need to organise the work of subcontractors. Therefore, the deadlines and the methods for implementing specific projects and project phases may be subject to change. This will require the smooth operation of government bodies and business representatives and expediting the implementation of import substitution programmes. This is an important point.

In the process, it is also important to simplify the procedure for cooperation between the regions and the federal government bodies and give the regions of the Federation more freedom in using resources and more opportunities for launching new construction projects and programmes.

Additional funding for road construction has already been allocated to the regions. I would like to ask the Government to consider an increase in funding other infrastructure facilities so work can start this year, and the possibility of building up purchases from Russian companies, for instance, with a view to upgrading public transport.

Obviously, this will be a serious additional burden on the budgets of the regions of the Russian Federation. Therefore, as we agreed, we will additionally adjust the subsidies to even out fiscal capacity. We will also use other measures for supporting regional finances. Thus, all payments on budget loans scheduled for this year will be suspended and payments on commercial loans will be replaced with budget loans wherever necessary. I would like to ask the Government to study this issue in detail and dig to the bottom of every case. Only a case-by-case approach will produce the desired effect.

In addition, the Finance Ministry will provide an additional unconditional credit line for every region. It will amount to 10 percent of total revenue with repayment no earlier than the end of this year.

We are going to maintain the same volume of infrastructure budget loans. I am instructing the Government to make arrangements for flexible management of this programme and to take account of the challenges involved in the implementation of the projects that I mentioned earlier. The regions should be able to take swift action on altering the portfolio and the contents of the projects, and focus on the ones that can be implemented as efficiently as possible in the current circumstances. If need be, we will explore the possibility of increasing the volume of infrastructure loans. This is possible and is quite feasible. In general, we will closely monitor regional finances and make additional decisions to support them, if need be.

I would like to emphasise that direct communication between all levels of government and a clear sequence of actions are of paramount importance now. The State Council and its specialised commissions have proved their effectiveness. I want the public administration commission led by Sergei Sobyanin to team up with our colleagues from the Government and to focus on problematic items on the regional agenda, to come up with the best solutions and to scale them to all Russian regions. We have gained extensive experience from combating the pandemic.

Colleagues,

Our economy, the state budget and private sector possess the necessary resources to address long-term tasks. All strategic and national goals that we have set for the period to 2030 must be achieved. The current challenges and the opportunities that they offer should mobilise us – this is what we should set our minds to in order to achieve tangible results in the interests of our people.

Clearly, we will need to fine-tune our programmes, and we welcome the initiatives coming from business circles, academics, and public associations. In this regard, I want the regions to join in organising the forum convened by the Agency for Strategic Initiatives titled, Powerful Ideas for New Times, where every Russian citizen will have a chance to present their proposals and specific projects for advancing their respective cities, regions, and our country as a whole.

To reiterate, the current developments represent a challenge for all of us. I am confident that we will come through with dignity. By working hard and working together, by supporting each other, we will overcome all challenges and emerge even stronger, as has always been the case in the thousand-year history of Russia. That is how I want you to think about this work.","Russian rhetoric, meanwhile, remained aggressive.

2022-03-22,"Russia displays a responsible approach to matters related to nuclear weapons, and never escalates anything, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said Tuesday.

""I believe that everything that was said on this topic, everything we’ve published, confirms an obvious thing: the question of potential use of our military nuclear potential is completely tied to the corresponding clauses of the Russian military doctrine and corresponding points of the basics of state policy on nuclear deterrence. We have an extremely responsible approach to this matter, and we never escalate anything,"" he said on Russian TV.

The Deputy Foreign Minister noted that Russia, together with other nuclear powers, has recently reaffirmed the basic principle that there could be no winners in a nuclear war, and such war must never be fought.

""Look what is happening on the other side: they speculate on the signals sent by the commander-in-chief in the changing operational situation. We have provided necessary explanations repeatedly. They keep raising this topic endlessly in their NATO and other formats, they post animation videos online with general calculations of potential consequences of an escalation scenario with use of nuclear weapons. This is playing on everyone’s nerves, it is yet another display of the Western cynicism,"" Ryabkov said.

The Deputy Foreign Minister reiterated that Russia is acting extremely responsibly in this sphere, and in strict compliance with publicly available doctrine documents.","Once again, some Russian officials started to walk back their government’s nuclear narratives. For instance, in a March 22 interview, Kremlin spokesman Peskov again claimed that Ukraine had sought
to develop nuclear weapons. However, when asked whether Putin would use nuclear weapons, he

in the event of an “existential threat” to Russia. There was no other reasons than the ones mentioned

2022-03-23,"Russia on Wednesday condemned what it called a ""reckless"" Polish proposal to send international peacekeepers into Ukraine and warned that it could lead to a direct clash between Russian and NATO forces. Poland said last Friday it would formally submit a proposal for a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine at the next NATO summit. Asked about the initiative, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""It would be a very reckless and extremely dangerous decision."" He told reporters on a conference call that any possible contact between Russian and NATO forces ""could have clear consequences that would be hard to repair"". Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces. Speaking in Kyiv last week, Poland's ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said: ""I think that it is necessary to have a peace mission - NATO, possibly some wider international structure - but a mission that will be able to defend itself, which will operate on Ukrainian territory."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also attacked the proposal in remarks to staff and students at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations on Wednesday. ""This will be the direct clash between the Russian and NATO armed forces that everyone has not only tried to avoid but said should not take place in principle,"" he said.

2022-03-23,"The White House has quietly assembled a team of national security officials to sketch out scenarios of how the United States and its allies should respond if President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia — frustrated by his lack of progress in Ukraine or determined to warn Western nations against intervening in the war — unleashes his stockpiles of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.

The Tiger Team, as the group is known, is also examining responses if Mr. Putin reaches into NATO territory to attack convoys bringing weapons and aid to Ukraine, according to several officials involved in the process. Meeting three times a week, in classified sessions, the team is also looking at responses if Russia seeks to extend the war to neighboring nations, including Moldova and Georgia, and how to prepare European countries for the refugees flowing in on a scale not seen in decades.

Those contingencies are expected to be central to an extraordinary session here in Brussels on Thursday, when President Biden meets leaders of the 29 other NATO nations, who will be meeting for the first time — behind closed doors, their cellphones and aides banished — since Mr. Putin invaded Ukraine.

Just a month ago, such scenarios seemed more theoretical. But today, from the White House to NATO’s headquarters in Brussels, a recognition has set in that Russia may turn to the most powerful weapons in its arsenal to bail itself out of a military stalemate.

NATO’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, underscored the urgency of the preparation effort on Wednesday, telling reporters for the first time that even if the Russians employ weapons of mass destruction only inside Ukraine, they may have “dire consequences” for people in NATO nations. He appeared to be discussing the fear that chemical or radioactive clouds could drift over the border. One issue under examination is whether such collateral damage would be considered an “attack” on NATO under its charter, which might require a joint military response.

The current team was established in a memo signed by Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, on Feb. 28, four days after the invasion began, according to the officials involved in the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive planning. A previous iteration had worked for months, behind the scenes, to prepare the U.S. government for the likelihood of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.

That team played a central role in devising the playbooks of deep sanctions, troop buildups in NATO nations and arming the Ukrainian military, which have exploited Russian weaknesses and put its government and economy under tremendous pressure.

Mr. Stoltenberg, sounding far more hawkish than in the past, said he expected “allies will agree to provide additional support, including cybersecurity assistance and equipment to help Ukraine protect against chemical, biological, radiologic and nuclear threats.”

As Mr. Biden flew to Europe on Wednesday, both he and Mr. Stoltenberg warned of growing evidence that Russia was in fact preparing to use chemical weapons in Ukraine.

These are questions that Europe has not confronted since the depths of the Cold War, when NATO had far fewer members, and Western Europe worried about a Soviet attack headed into Germany. But few of the leaders set to meet in Brussels on Thursday ever had to deal with those scenarios — and many have never had to think about nuclear deterrence or the effects of the detonation of battlefield nuclear weapons, designed to be less powerful than those that destroyed Hiroshima. The fear is that Russia is more likely to use those weapons, precisely because they erode the distinction between conventional and nuclear arms.

Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, said on Wednesday that if Mr. Putin used a weapon of mass destruction — chemical, biological or nuclear — “there would be consequences” even if the weapon’s use was confined to Ukraine. Mr. Reed said radiation from a nuclear weapon, for instance, could waft into a neighboring NATO country and be considered an attack on a NATO member.

“It’s going to be a very difficult call, but it’s a call that not just the president but the entire NATO Council will have to make,” Mr. Reed told reporters, referring to the governing body of the Western alliance.

“The bottom line is this is a NATO decision,” Mr. Reed said. “It won’t be the president’s decision alone. I don’t think he’d want to take action unilaterally.”

One major issue the Tiger Team is looking at is the threshold that could prompt the alliance to use military force in Ukraine. Mr. Biden has made clear that he is enormously reluctant to do so, fearing that direct confrontation with Russia could escalate the conflict beyond control. “That’s World War III,” he noted recently.

A second team of officials, also created by Mr. Sullivan’s Feb. 28 memo, is looking at long-term opportunities for the United States to improve its geopolitical position as a result of Mr. Putin’s invasion. Inside the White House, it has become an article of faith that the Russian leader made a huge strategic error — one that will diminish Russia’s standing, cripple its economy and alienate potential allies for years. But it is early in the conflict, other officials caution, and that conclusion may prove premature.

The immediate concern is what Mr. Putin may do next — driven by a desire to rescue a failing military effort or re-establish his credentials as a force to be feared.

Officials believe the chances that Mr. Putin will resort to detonating a nuclear weapon are small. But Russia’s steady stream of reminders that it has its arsenal at the ready, and could use it in response to anything it perceives as an “existential threat,” has put Washington on high alert.

Mr. Biden will take up with allies “how to deal with the rhetoric and the commentary coming out of Russia on this whole question of the potential use of nuclear weapons,” Mr. Sullivan told reporters on Wednesday.

“We haven’t seen anything that’s made us adjust our posture, our nuclear posture, but it is of course something we will have to continue to stay in close consultation with allies and partners on, as well as communicate directly to the Russians.”

Several officials said the White House and Pentagon have had some tension over how much detail the Defense Department is willing to share on its highly secretive war planning — especially concerning responses to any use of nuclear weapons — even in the classified setting of the Tiger Team. (The term has been used for many years to describe an emergency task force inside the National Security Council.)

A U.S. official said Mr. Biden remained adamant about keeping American forces out of Ukraine. But the official said the administration believed it would be misguided not to closely examine the thresholds, if any, under which the president would reverse himself, or to be prepared to deal with the consequences of the use of weapons of mass destruction.

A senior administration official said any use of a “small” tactical nuclear bomb by Russia — even inside Ukraine and not directed at a NATO member — would mean that “all bets are off” on the United States and NATO staying out of the war. But when pushed, the official declined to lay out the responses under discussion.

The official said American and NATO intelligence communities had not seen any activity by Russian military officials that suggested preparations to use a nuclear weapon. But he said that during internal discussions, administration officials were urging caution, because there was more at stake than just Ukraine.

If Mr. Putin did strike a NATO country intentionally, he would not only bring the force of the military alliance to bear on Russia, but also probably find himself facing NATO troops inside Ukraine, Artis Pabriks, Latvia’s defense minister, told reporters traveling in his country this month with Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

“He will get Article 5,” Mr. Pabriks said, in a reference to the NATO pledge that an attack on one alliance member is an attack on all.

“If he gets that, basically that would also make us involved in Ukraine,” Mr. Pabriks said, adding: “He has no way out of that. So I don’t think he should be so stupid.”

Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent and a member of the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, visited the Polish-Ukrainian border over the weekend, meeting with officials from allied countries, visiting a refugee processing center and talking with Ukrainians. Mr. King said that as Russian forces struggle to make headway, Mr. Putin could try to strike a diplomatic agreement, intensify his bombardment of Ukrainian cities and level them, or lash out against the West with a cyberattack.

“The fourth is escalate to de-escalate, which is a tactical nuclear weapon,” Mr. King said, using the term for a Russian military doctrine in which it would employ a nuclear weapon as a warning — and then negotiate.","On the same day, on March 23, US media reports suggested a marked hardening in US rhetoric regarding a potential Russian nuclear use. According to a Biden administration official, the US president
“remained adamant about keeping American forces out of Ukraine.” Yet “it would be misguided not to
closely examine the thresholds, if any, under which the president would reverse himself.” Even the
use of sub-strategic nuclear weapons inside Ukraine “would mean that ‘all bets are off’ on the United
States and NATO staying out of the war,” a senior official reportedly said. Similarly, Democratic Senator and Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed also suggested that a Russian attack with
chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine would have “consequences.”
A nuclear attack inside Ukraine could even “be considered an attack on a NATO member,” if nuclear
radiation were to be blown into a NATO state, he reportedly added. However, according to US officials, the Biden administration so far considered the likelihood of a nuclear attack to be low. Neither
the US nor NATO had observed any military actions indicating Russia was preparing a nuclear strike,
said a senior official. “We haven’t seen anything that’s made us adjust our posture, our nuclear posture,” National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also confirmed."," Anonymous Biden administration official: Use of a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine would mean “all bets are off” regarding direct US intervention in the

2022-03-23,"THE PRESIDENT:  Good evening, everyone.  With all the press that’s here, you must be getting very tired.  Am I the 16th or 17th?  At any rate, all kidding aside, thank you for taking the time.

I — today marks one month since Russia began its carnage in Ukraine, the brutal invasion of Ukraine.  And we held a NATO summit the very next day.  At that time, my overwhelming objective, wanting that summit, was to have absolute unity on three key important issues among our NATO and European allies.

First was to support Ukraine with military and humanitarian assistance. 

Second was to impose the most significant — the most significant sanctions — economic sanction regime ever, in order to cripple Putin’s economy and punish him for his actions.

Third was to fortify the eastern flank of our NATO Allies, who were obviously very, very concerned and somewhat at — worried what would happen.

We accomplished all three of these.  And today, we’re determined to sustain those efforts and to build on them.
The United States has committed to provide over $2 billion in military equipment to Ukraine since I became President — anti-air systems, anti-armor systems, ammunition.  And our weapons are flowing into Ukraine as I speak.

And today, I’m announcing the United States have prepared to commit more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to help get relief to millions of Ukrainians affected by the war in Ukraine.

Many Ukrainian refugees will wish to stay in Europe, closer to their homes.  But we’ve also — will welcome 100,000 Ukrainians to the United States with a focus on reuniting families. 

And we will invest $320 million to bolster democratic resilience and defend human rights in Ukraine and neighboring countries.

We’re also coordinating with the G7 and the European Union on food security, as well as energy security, and I’ll have more to say about that tomorrow.

We’re also announcing new sanctions of more than 400 individuals and entities aligned with — in alignment with the European Union: more than 300 members of the Duma, oligarchs, and Russian defense companies that fuel the Russian war machine.

In addition to the 100,000 U.S. forces now stationed in Europe to defend NATO territory, NATO established, as you already know, four new battle groups in Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Slovakia to reinforce the eastern front.

Putin was banking on NATO being split.  In my early conversation with him in December and early January, it was clear to me he didn’t think we could sustain this cohesion.

NATO has never, never been more united than it is today.  Putin is getting exactly the opposite of what he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine. 

We built that same unity with our European — the European Union and with the leading democracies of the G7 — in the G7. 

So I want to thank you, and I’ll be now happy to take your questions.  Since there’s so many people out there, I’m going to — I’ve been given a list. 

Now, how about Chris with the Associated Press?  First question.

Q    Hi.  Thank you, Mr. President.  So you’ve warned about the real threat of chemical weapons being used.  Have you gathered specific intelligence that suggests that President Putin is deploying these weapons, moving them to position, or considering their use?

And would the U.S. or NATO respond with military action if he did use chemical weapons?

THE PRESIDENT:  You know, on the first question, I can’t answer that.  I’m not going to give you intelligence data, number one.

Number two, we would respond.  We would respond if he uses it.  The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.

Josh, of Bloomberg.

Q    Perhaps I’ll just project, Mr. President.  Thank you very much.

THE PRESIDENT:  If I had your voice, I’d had been elected a lot earlier.  (Laughter.)

Q    (Microphone is extended towards press member.)  Okay.  I’ll give — I’ll give it a try.  It’s got a long arm.  Thank you.

Can you talk to us about two things, sir: One, since your conversation with President Xi of China, have you seen any indications of action or lack of action from China that has led you to believe whether they will intervene and help Russia either with the sale of arms or the provision of supplies to support this war in Ukraine?
And secondly, can you say whether this — the conversation today turned to the subject of food shortages, and what the U.S. will do to address wheat shortages, in particular, as a result of this war?  Thank you.

THE PRESIDENT:  On the first question relating to President Xi Jinping of China, I had a very straightforward conversation with Xi — now, I guess, it’s six days ago, seven days ago — in that range.

And I made it clear to him — I made no threats, but I made it clear to him that — make sure he understood the consequences of him helping Russia, as had been reported and as what was expected. 

And I made no threats, but I pointed out the number of American and foreign corporations that left Russia as a consequence of their barbaric behavior.  And I indicated that I knew how much he — because we had long discussions in the past about his interest in making sure he has economic relations and economic growth with Europe and the United States — and indicated that he’d be putting himself in significant jeopardy and those — in those aims if, in fact, he were to move forward.

I am not going to comment on any detail about what we know or don’t know as a consequence of that conversation.  But tomorrow is — is it tomorrow or next Monday that Ursula is having that conference with China?

WHITE HOUSE AIDE:  April 1st.

THE PRESIDENT:  The 1st — on April 1st.

We’ve had discussions — because I think that China understands that its economic future is much more closely tied to the West than it is to Russia.  And so I — I’m hopeful that he — he does not get engaged.
We also did discuss today that there’s a need for us to set up, NATO to set up, and — and the EU — to set up a system whereby we have an organization looking at who has violated any of the sanctions, and where and when and how they violated them.  And that’s something we’re going to put in train.  It’s not done yet. 

So, with regard to Xi, I — I have nothing more to report.
 
With regard to food shortage, yes, we did talk about food shortages.  And — and it’s going to be real.  The price of these sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia, it’s imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries and our country as well.  And — because both Russia and Ukraine have been the breadbasket of Europe in terms of wheat, for example — just to give you one example. 
 
But we had a long discussion in the G7 with the — with both the United States, which has a significant — the third-largest producer of wheat in the world — as well as Canada, which is also a major, major producer.  And we both talked about how we could increase and disseminate more rapidly food.  Food shortages.
 
And in addition to that, we talked about urging all the European countries and everyone else to end trade restrictions on — on sending — limitations on sending food abroad.  And so, we are in the process of working out, with our European friends, what it would be — what it would take to help alleviate the concerns relative to food shortages. 
 
We also talked about a significant, major U.S. investment, among others, in terms of providing for the need for humanitarian assistance, including food, as we move forward. 
 
Tarini, of the Wall Street Journal.  Watch out you don’t get hit in the head there now.  (Laughter.)
 
Q    Mr. President, in your view, does President Zelenskyy need to cede any Ukrainian territory in order to gain a ceasefire with Russia?  Or is that completely off the table?
 
And then also, do you think that Russia needs to be removed from the G20?
 
THE PRESIDENT:  On the latter point, my answer is yes.  That depends on the G20.  I — that was raised today.  And I raised the possibility, if that can’t be done — if Indonesia and others do not agree, then we should, in my view, ask to have both Ukraine be able to attend the meetings, as well as — well, basically Ukraine being able to attend the G20 meetings and observe.
 
With regard to — what was the first question? 
 
Q    If you think that Ukraine needs to cease — to give up any territory in order to get a ceasefire.
 
THE PRESIDENT:  That is a total judgment based on Ukraine.  “Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.”  I don’t believe that they’re going to have to do that, but that’s a judgment.  There’s negotiations — that are discussions, I should say — that have taken place that I have not been part of, including Ukrainians.  And it’s — it’s their judgment to make. 
 
Cecilia, ABC.  There you are. 
 
Oop.
 
Q    Oh, (inaudible).  Thank you. 
 
Sir, you’ve made it very clear in this conflict that you do not want to see World War Three.  But is it possible that, in expressing that so early, that you were too quick to rule out direct military intervention in this war?  Could Putin have been emboldened, knowing that you were not going to get involved directly in this conflict?
 
THE PRESIDENT:  No and no. 
 
Q    You do not believe that?
 
And to clarify, on chemical weapons: Could — if chemical weapons were used in Ukraine, would that trigger a military response from NATO?
 
THE PRESIDENT:  It would re- — it would trigger a response in kind, whether or not — you’re asking whether NATO would cross; we’d make that decision at the time. 
 
Q    And my final question: Because you’re heading to Poland tomorrow, do you think that getting a firsthand look at the effects of this war on these millions of Ukrainians who have fled their country could change the way that you might respond?
 
THE PRESIDENT:  I don’t think so, because I’ve been to many, many warzones.  I’ve been in refugee camps.  I’ve been in warzones for the last 15 years.  And it’s — it’s devastating.  And what — the thing you look at the most is you see these young children, you see children without parents that are in those camps or in — or refugees.  You see women and husbands — men and women who are completely lost and have no — you see the look — that blank look on their face, that absolute feeling of, “My God, where am I?  What’s going to happen to me?” 
 
And so, it — what it will do, it will reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks, as well as humanitarian assistance needed both inside Ukraine and outside Ukraine. 
 
For example, this is not something that Poland or Romania or Germany should carry on their own.  This is an international responsibility.  And the United States, as the leader — one of the leaders in the international community, has an obligation to be engaged — to be engaged and do all we can to ease the suffering and pain of innocent women and children, and men, for that matter, throughout — throughout Ukraine and those who have made it across the border.
 
I plan on attempting to see those folks, as well as I hope I’m going to be able to see — I guess I’m not supposed to say where I’m going, am I?  But anyway, I hope I get to see a lot of people.  (Laughter.)
 
Markus, with Der Spiegel.
 
Q    Thanks, Mr. President.  There’s a presidential election coming up in 2024.  And as you know, there are wide- —
 
THE PRESIDENT:  You’re kidding. 
 
Q    Yes.  (Laughter.)  It’s true.  And there are widespread concerns in Europe that a figure like your predecessor, maybe even your predecessor himself, might get elected president again.  So, are there any steps, anything you’re trying to do and NATO is trying to do here, these days, to prevent what you’re trying to do becoming undone two years from now?  Thank you.
 
THE PRESIDENT:  No, I — that’s not how I think of this.  I’ve been dealing with foreign policy for longer than anybody that’s involved in this process right now.  I have no concerns about the impact —

I made a commitment when I ran this time.  I wasn’t going to run again, and I mean that sincerely.  I had no intention of running for President again and — until I saw those folks coming out of the fields in Virginia carrying torches and carrying Nazi banners and literally singing the same vile rhyme that they used in Germany in the early ‘20s — or ‘30s, I should say.  And then, when the gentleman you mentioned was asked what he thought — and a young woman was killed, a protester — and he asked — was asked what he thought, he said, “There are very good people on both sides.”  And that’s when I decided I wasn’t going to be quiet any longer.
 
And when I ran this time — and I think the American press, whether they look at me favorably or unfavorably, acknowledge this — I made a determination: Nothing is worth — no election is worth my not doing exactly what I think is the right thing.  Not a joke.  I’m too long in the tooth to fool with this any longer. 
 
And so, we’re a long way off in elections — a long way off.  My focus of any election is on making sure that we retain the House and the United States Senate so that I have the room to continue to do the things that I’ve been able to do in terms of grow the economy and deal in a rational way with American foreign policy and lead the world — lead the — be the leader of the free world. 
 
So — but it’s not a — it’s not an illogical question for someone to ask.  I say to people at home: Imagine if we sat and watched the doors of the Bundestag broken down and police officers killed and hundreds of people storming in, or imagine if we saw that happening in the British Parliament or whatever.  How would we feel? 
 
And one of the things that I take some solace from is: I don’t think you’ll find any European leader who thinks that I am not up to the job.  And I mean that sincerely.  It’s not like, “Whoa…”  It’s that — that —
 
The point is that when — the first G7 meeting I attended, like the one I did today, was in Great Britain.  And I sat down, and I said, “America is back.”  And one of the — one of my counterparts, colleagues, a head of state, said, “For how long?”  “For how long?” 
 
And so, I don’t blame — I don’t — I don’t criticize anybody for asking that question.  But the next election, I’d be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me.
 
Thank you very, very much. 
 
(Cross-talk by reporters.)
 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no — yeah, one final question.  Right. 
 
(Cross-talk by reporters.)
 
Hey, well, wait — hold on a second, please.  I was supposed to be, an hour ago, at the European Union meeting and — to speak.
 
Q    Thank you, Mr. President.

Q    Mr. President —
 
THE PRESIDENT:  Who are you?
 
Q    I’m Christina Ruffini from CBS.  Thank you, sir.
 
THE PRESIDENT:  Okay. 
 
Q    Sir, deterrence didn’t work.  What makes you think Vladimir Putin will alter course based on the action you’ve taken today?
 
THE PRESIDENT:  Let’s get something straight: You remember, if you’ve covered me from the beginning, I did not say that in fact the sanctions would deter him.  Sanctions never deter.  You keep talking about that. 
 
Sanctions never deter.  The maintenance of sanctions — the maintenance of sanctions, the increasing the pain, and the demonstration — why I asked for this NATO meeting today — is to be sure that after a month, we will sustain what we’re doing not just next month, the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year.  That’s what will stop him.
 
Q    Do you believe the actions today will have an impact on making Russia change course in Ukraine?
 
THE PRESIDENT:  That’s not what I said.  You — you — you’re playing a game with me. 
 
Q    (Inaudible.)  (Off-mic.)
 
THE PRESIDENT:  I know.  The answer is no. 
 
I think what happens is, we have to demonstrate — the purpose — the single-most important thing is for us to stay unified, and the world continue to focus on what a brute this guy is and all the innocent people’s lives that are being lost and ruined, and what’s going on.  That’s the important thing. 
 
But, look, if you’re Putin and you think that the — that Europe is going to crack in a month or six weeks or two months, why not — they can take anything for another month. 
 
But we have to demonstrate — the reason I asked for the meeting — we have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united.

2022-03-26,"The Kremlin again raised the spectre of the use of nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine as Russian forces struggled to hold a key city in the south of the country.

Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is deputy chairman of the country’s security council, said Moscow could strike against an enemy that only used conventional weapons while Vladimir Putin’s defence minister claimed nuclear “readiness” was a priority.

The comments on Saturday prompted Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in an appearance by video link at Qatar’s Doha Forum to warn that Moscow was a direct threat to the world.

The Kremlin again raised the spectre of the use of nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine as Russian forces struggled to hold a key city in the south of the country.

Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is deputy chairman of the country’s security council, said Moscow could strike against an enemy that only used conventional weapons while Vladimir Putin’s defence minister claimed nuclear “readiness” was a priority.

The comments on Saturday prompted Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in an appearance by video link at Qatar’s Doha Forum to warn that Moscow was a direct threat to the world.

“Russia is deliberating bragging they can destroy with nuclear weapons, not only a certain country but the entire planet,” Zelenskiy said.

Putin established the nuclear threat at the start of the war, warning that western intervention would reap “consequences you have never seen”.

Western officials have said the threats may be simply an attempt to divert attention from the failure of Putin’s forces to secure a swift occupation of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and to make advances in other key areas of the country.

An adviser to Ukraine’s defence ministry, Markian Lubkivskyi, claimed on Saturday that Russia would soon lose control of the southern city of Kherson, the first major centre to fall to the Kremlin since the war began on 24 February.

He said: “I believe that today the city will be fully under the control of Ukrainian armed forces. We have finished in the last two days the operation in the Kyiv region so other armed forces are now focused on the southern part trying to get free Kherson and some other Ukrainian cities.”

Russia has approximately 6,000 nuclear warheads – the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world. In an interview on Saturday, Medvedev said Russia’s nuclear doctrine did not require an enemy state to use such weapons first.

He said: “We have a special document on nuclear deterrence. This document clearly indicates the grounds on which the Russian Federation is entitled to use nuclear weapons. There are a few of them, let me remind them to you: number one is the situation, when Russia is struck by a nuclear missile. The second case is any use of other nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies.


“The third is an attack on a critical infrastructure that will have paralysed our nuclear deterrent forces. And the fourth case is when an act of aggression is committed against Russia and its allies, which jeopardised the existence of the country itself, even without the use of nuclear weapons, that is, with the use of conventional weapons.”

Medvedev added that there was a “determination to defend the independence, sovereignty of our country, not to give anyone a reason to doubt even the slightest that we are ready to give a worthy response to any infringement on our country, on its independence”.

Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, who had not been seen for 12 days before a brief appearance on Friday and an address to his generals on Saturday, also spoke about the nuclear threat contained within Russia’s arsenal.

In a video, uploaded on social media by the Russian defence ministry, Shoigu said he had discussed issues related to the military budget and defence orders with the finance ministry.

He said: “We continue ahead-of-schedule delivery of weaponry and equipment by means of credits. The priorities are long-range, high-precision weapons, aircraft equipment and maintenance of engagement readiness of strategic nuclear forces.”","On March 26, Medvedev once again emphasized the expansive nature of Russia’s nuclear doctrine.
According to its own “special document on nuclear deterrence,” Moscow was “entitled” to use nuclear
weapons in four instances. The fourth case was when “an act of aggression” was “committed against
Russia and its allies, which jeopardized the existence of the country itself, even without the use of nuclear weapons, that is, with the use of conventional weapons.” The Russian government possessed a
“determination to defend the independence, sovereignty of our country, not to give anyone a reason to doubt even the slightest that we are ready to give a worthy response to any infringement on our
country, on its independence.”"," Medvedev: Russia could use nuclear weapons if its existence is
threatened, even by conventional weapons.

2022-03-28,"No one in Russia is considering the idea of using nuclear weapons, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told PBS.

The interviewer asked whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had suggested in his earlier statement that he would use nuclear weapons if a third party got involved in the conflict in Ukraine and Peskov said ‘no.’ ""I don’t think so. But he was quite bold in saying ‘do not interfere, if you do, we have all the possibilities to prevent that and to punish all those who are going to interfere,"" he specified.

When asked if he could rule out the use of nuclear weapons in the conflict on behalf of Russia, the Kremlin spokesman said: ""No one is thinking about using… even about the idea of using nuclear weapons."".

US President Joe Biden’s recent remark about Russian leader Vladimir Putin is quite alarming, Peskov told.

""It's quite alarming. First of all, it's a personal insult and one can hardly imagine a place for a personal insult in the rhetoric of a political leader and especially of the political leader of the greatest country in the world, the United States. So we are very sorry about that,"" he pointed out. ""His statement about whether Putin should not or should be in power in Russia is of course unacceptable. It's not for the United States' president to decide who is going to be and who is the president of Russia, it is the people of Russia who decide it during elections,"" Peskov added.

Western countries have actually declared total economic war against Russia, Peskov told.

""We have to adapt ourselves to new conditions. And unfortunately, those conditions are quite unfriendly,"" he said, commenting on Western sanctions.

""We entered the phase of a total war,"" Peskov pointed out. ""Western European countries, the United States, Canada, Australia, they are actually leading war against us in trade, in economy, in seizing our properties, in seizing our funds, in blocking our financial relations. And we have to adapt ourselves to the new reality,"" the Kremlin spokesman stressed.","Biden’s controversial remarks did not result in an escalation of Russian nuclear rhetoric. On March
28, Kremlin spokesperson Peskov did emphasize that Biden’s statements about Putin were “alarming,” a “personal insult” and “unacceptable.” “It’s not for the United States’ president to decide who is
going to be and who is the president of Russia, it is the people of Russia who decide it during elections,” he explained. However, in the same interview Peskov also clarified and revised previous nuclear threats, citing Russian doctrine. “Any outcome” of Russia’s operation in Ukraine “of course, is
not a reason for usage of a nuclear weapon,” he said. Russia, he said, had a security concept that “very
clearly states that only when there is a threat for the existence of the state in our country, we can use
and we will actually use nuclear weapons to eliminate the threat for the existence of our country.”
“Let’s keep these two things separate ... the existence of the state and the special military operation in
Ukraine,” Peskov said. “They have nothing to do with each other.”
Nevertheless, the Kremlin spokesman also recalled “the initial statement of [Putin] … when he ordered the operation on the 24th February,” in which he warned various states “not to interfere in affairs between Ukraine and Russia during this operation.” “Everyone understands what he meant [by
that],” Peskov declared. When asked if that meant Putin would use nuclear weapons if a third country
intervened in Ukraine, he said, “I don’t think so,” although Putin had made it clear that no one should
interfere. If anyone did, Peskov explained, Russia had “all the possibilities to prevent that and punish all those who are going to interfere.” However, “no one is thinking about using, not even about the
idea of using a nuclear weapon.”
Asked about a scenario in which Russia might send troops to or bomb a NATO country, Peskov remained cautious: “If it’s not a reciprocal act, so if they don’t make us do that, we cannot think about
that and we do not want to think about that.”"," Peskov: Any outcome of the operation in Ukraine is “of
course” not a reason to use nuclear weapons, only an existential threat would be. But: Everyone understands what Putin meant with his warning “not to interfere.” And: He does “not
think” Putin would use nuclear weapons if a third country intervened in Ukraine. But: Russia
has “all the possibilities” to punish such states. But: “No one is thinking about using, even
about the idea of using a nuclear weapon.”
",r,D,
2022-03-31,"SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Okay, good morning, everybody. We'll get started.

Not a whole lot of updates today from yesterday. Day 36, we continue to observe some Russian forces begin to continue to observe them repositioning away from Kyiv, particularly from the north and northwest of Kyiv. I don't have an update on quantity. We haven't observed that much of a difference over the last 24 hours, so I'd still roughly leave it at about 20 percent or so. There hasn't been and so it hasn't been sort of, you know, wholesale movement, at least not at this point.

I would say that again, despite the rhetoric of de-escalations, we're still observing artillery fire and airstrikes in and around Kyiv. They're still fighting to the north of Kyiv. As these forces begin to repositioning, the Ukrainians are moving against them. Still fighting around Chernihiv, and again, we believe that the Ukrainians still have lines of communication there in Chernihiv.

Obviously, and again, you guys know this – while Russian forces haven't made any major gains, there's fighting that continues in southern and eastern Ukraine, and that includes Kharkiv, Mariupol and Mykolaiv. We do continue to observe some Russian forces inside Mariupol, but obviously, the Ukrainians are fighting very, very tough inside the city.

The airspace remains contested; again, no changes to that. We've observed now no big, major muscle-movement changes in the missile launches; still observe more than 1,400 as of today. There's nothing new in the maritime environment to speak to.

On Mykolaiv, no really major change to the battlespace around Mykolaiv. We still assess that the Ukrainians are still fighting for Kherson and the degree to which the Russians are sort of positioned, it's sort of in between Kherson and Mykolaiv.

We have seen the Russians continue to increase their number of sorties, aircraft sorties, in last 24 hours, up over 300. And their strikes are focused on Kyiv, Chernihiv, Izyum, which we've talked about before, to the south of Kharkiv, and then that joint force operation area, basically, the Donbas.

Those are sort of the four areas where they're conducting most of their strikes. So again, for all the talk of de-escalation and moving away, Kyiv is still very much under threat from airstrikes.

And think I'll leave it at that. Again, not a whole lot of change from yesterday.

Bob?

Q: Thank you. I actually was a little bit unclear on your use of the 20 percent number. Are you referring to, in other words, 20 percent of what? Are you talking about forces that include not just those to the north and northwest of Kyiv, but also the Chernihiv area? And you also mentioned Sumy yesterday. I'm wondering what the ,you know, sort of the geographic area that is 20 percent of what, kind of thing?

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Yeah, I was referring to the forces that they had arrayed against Kyiv specifically.

Q: Well, so do you consider that to include those in the northeast coming through Chernihiv?

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: No, I was counting -- I was just talking about Kyiv, because that was the big, that was the big muscle movement. That's what the Russians announced, was they were going to leave Kyiv alone. You know, we've seen some minor movements in other, in other places to the…around the northern part of the country, but largely it's -- it's around Kyiv that we're starting to see this repositioning. And so the I said it was less than 20 percent, that it was a rough estimate. We don't have a perfect count, and what I was referring to was the force that Putin had arrayed against Kyiv. I wasn't counting other places because frankly, we just haven't seen that much coming out of other place.

Q: Okay. The other quick question on the same topic was when you made your introductory remarks, you said that the Ukrainians are moving against them. Now, are you referring to those forces that are repositioning, or just in general in the north of Kyiv?

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Well, I mean, I guess it's a good question. It's both, but what I was referring to was -- was that they are attacking some of the repositioning forces, that they're moving against them as they begin to reposition. But they have consistently been going on the offensive around Kyiv even before the Russians made decisions to start to reposition, even when they were just in defensive positions and sort of stalled and not moving forward, the Ukrainians were working against them. So it's a little bit of both, but I was specifically referring to them pressing their attacks against some of these units that are repositioning.

Q: All right.

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Okay, Howard Altman?

Q: Thank you. A couple of questions. The Ukrainians say they're concerned about Chernobyl's a number of things. One is the presence of a great deal of ammunition there that they are concerned about that could accidentally explode, the presence of rocket systems there that could be used to attack from there. And then if the Russians withdraw, their concern about a Russian missile strike on the facility. Does the Pentagon share any of those concerns? And can you confirm the presence of (continued ?) presence of Russian troops and those rocket systems there?

And then my second question is, can you talk about the -- the explosion at the Belgrade Russian facility - ammunition facility and whether that was a strike by Ukraine? Thanks.

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: On the first question, you know, obviously, since the Russians moved into Chernobyl we said very clearly that we were concerned about their occupation of that defunct nuclear facility and our concerns over their lack of understanding or adherence to any kind of safety protocols. So that's a long-standing concern.

I don't have the level of detail you're getting from the Ukrainians on rockets being left there, or how many Russians are there. We have seen them begin to reposition away from Chernobyl, but I couldn't give you a nose count of how many are still there or what they might have left. So I can't help you on that.

And on the Belgorad strike, the farthest I'm willing to go on that is, you know, we -- we can't -- we can't confirm exactly what happened there, what kind of munition was used or -- or exactly from where it came. But we're not in a position to refute the possibility that it could have come from the Ukrainian side. We just don't have a whole lot more that we can say about it.

Tom Bowman?

Q: Yeah, any updates on Russian replacement troops heading in from Georgia, presumably to the Donbas?

And also, I was wondering if you can say anything more about Putin being misinformed or receiving little information from his generals?

Do you see him removing commanders, firing generals?

And also, it there a sense what the implications of this might be?

If he's not getting the right information and maybe he's suddenly realizing how bad things are, he could lash out even more. Is there any talk about that?

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Well, on your first question I don't have any updates on reinforcements.

On the second question, we haven't seen any tangible outcomes, based on our assessment, that Mr. Putin is being misinformed or is perhaps uninformed. So you know, no dots we can connect there that correlate to decisions that the Russians have made, or he has made, on the battlefield -- other than -- I mean, again, it doesn't really answer the question, but, I mean, clearly, this repositioning that they're doing around Kyiv and -- and other places in the north, and this re-prioritization on the Donbas, clearly indicate that they know they have failed to take the capital city, that they know they have been under increased pressure elsewhere around the country. Because they are obviously making decisions to alter their goals and objectives.

Now, whether that itself is an outcome of Mr. Putin all of a sudden getting informed, we don't know. So I can't point to a specific decision point or a specific action that the Russians are taking and tell you that that's evidence that, you know, Mr. Putin is now more informed than he was before.

And as I said -- as the Pentagon briefer said yesterday, I mean, clearly, it's cause for concern if he's not being told the truth, if he's not -- if he's being misinformed, I think, the gist of your question, because you don't know how he's going to react when he -- when he does get fully informed. And you don't know how that's going to affect their legitimate, to the degree they could be legitimate, their negotiating tactics at the table.

So, yes, we're concerned about the -- the reports that he may not have the full information.

Now, again, how much of that has changed? You know, we can't measure that. We don't know. All we do know and all we can talk about is what we're seeing. And we're seeing them adjust. We're seeing them now focus on the Donbas. We're seeing them start to reposition troops. We continue to believe that this is a repositioning. We certainly haven't seen any indication that any of these troops are going back home or that they're being taken away from the fight forever.

What we continue to believe is that these troops will be refit and put back into Ukraine in some place and in some fashion to continue the fight along what we believe their new objectives are, which is largely in the east.

Q: And, also, you talked about morale in the past, morale not being good among Russian forces. Any detail, any indications of that?

Is it getting worse? Are soldiers disobeying orders?

There was a report of Russian troops, you know, running over their commander.

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Yeah, I can't confirm any of those anecdotes. I know that there was another report out there that they've shot down by accident their own aircraft, and we can't confirm that.

I would just tell you that we have continued to see unit cohesion issues, command-and-control problems, problems of faulty leadership. And certainly we have continued to see, again, anecdotal evidence of poor morale and poor performance by troops on the battlefield.

But, as I've said before, it's anecdotal. We can't say with certainty that it's uniformly across all the force that they have in Ukraine. But I just want to go back to some of the core ideas here. One, this is an operation, an armed conflict on the scale that the Russians have not attempted in a very, very, very long time, on multiple lines of axis, with poor coordination between elements in subordinate commands, poor planning for logistics and sustainment, anecdotal evidence that they haven't even been honest with their troops about what it is that they were about to do, and largely depending on conscripts to fight it -- so not career soldiers.

Also, you know, it's a military that doesn't have a noncommissioned officer corps the way that the West does. And so we are not seeing a lot of small-unit leadership or even any initiative at lower levels. It's a very top-down driven military. And we think that some of the problems they have had directly result from that leadership organizational structure.

Q: All right, thanks.

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Tom Squitieri?

Yeah, Tom Squitieri?

Q: Thanks. Good morning. In the lead-up to the invasion and since, the information that the Pentagon has provided has really tracked well with those from other sources, the U.K. and another analysts, except in one area.

Without getting into intelligence matters, why do you think there's a dissonance between reports that others have of Russian troops leaving other parts of Russia -- in other words, a (inaudible) coming towards Ukraine, and the Pentagon's not saying the same thing?

Thanks.

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: All I would tell you is that we are doing the best we can to share with you what we can share with you. There are things that we can't share with you that we believe we know, but we're not going to share it with you because we have to be sensitive about the way we know it.

So all I can tell you, in good faith, is that we're providing as much context as we can, with that caveat and the other caveat being that we can't possibly know everything that's going on at every moment inside Ukraine because we're not there.

I've made no bones about the fact that in the past, that there's going to be gaps in our assessments, gaps in our knowledge, that we might see something one day and then the next day, we'll see it a different way because we'll just simply know more.

So all I can tell you is we're doing the best we can to provide what we're comfortable providing. I'm comfortable that what I decide to share with you, I'm comfortable with it -- with it coming out on behalf of a Senior Defense Official, and if I can't get myself there, if I can't be comfortable with it, then we're not sharing it.

Heather from USNI?

Q: Thank you so much. I was wondering if you have any comments about the maritime space from the idea of merchants in the port potentially being stuck on their ships or not being able to get out? Any updates on any ships that have been -- merchant ships that have been damaged? And then if you have any comments on how this is affecting the global food sources?

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: I don't have any updates on commercial shipping. We know that the -- that the Russians have continued to blockade Odesa. So obviously it's having -- it's having an economic impact there, certainly inside Ukraine, no question about it.

But what that represents on the global scale, I just don't know, Heather, and I don't have the data on food and what it's doing to the food market. That's just not something we would be tracking here at the Department of Defense.

David Martin?

Q: The two place names that have been associated with the Russian pullback from around Kyiv have been Hostomel and Chernobyl. Do you have any other place names for that?

And since Donbas seems to be now the priority theater, could you give us an update on what progress the -- the Russians have made there since the start of the war? I mean, you -- you always talk about trying to link up that line between Kharkiv and Mariupol, but just on the line of contact there, have -- have the Russians advanced past the original line of contact? How much farther are they into the Donbas region?

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: So no other specific geographic locations to talk about in terms of -- of drawing down. It is largely from Chernobyl and from the north and northwest of Kyiv. I would tell you that we believe that they have very likely abandoned Hostomel airfield, also known as Antonov too, but other than that, those are the two place names that we're mostly focused on right now.

And as for your other question, they have not geographically made much progress in the east. I mean, they are south of Izyum. We talked about that a few days ago, that they got to be 10 to 15 kilometers south of -- actually southeast of Izyum. They're sort of moving down a highway that travels from northwest to southeast into the Donbas region, and that seems to be the line of advance that they're trying to pursue but they have been stymied by Ukrainians and haven't really made much more progress to this coming -- coming south.

Obviously, we believe one of the reasons that they want Mariupol so badly is so that they can move to the north, coming out of Mariupol, and obviously Mariupol is still very much contested. So not a whole lot of progress by the Russians to come up from the south.

We do assess that, as I said before, that the Joint Forces operations area -- basically the area between Donetsk and Luhansk and and then further east, to the rest of the -- the Donbas area -- that area still remains high for kinetic activity, it remains a focus area of their airstrikes.

I talked about Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, and then of course the JFO. Those are the areas where they're really doing the most air activity. So they have poured more effort into that, but as for actual progress, pinching it off or sealing it off and fixing Ukrainian Armed Forces, they have been frustrated and not -- not successful.

Now, again, David, we'll see what happens here going forward, as they begin to -- to get these repositioned troops out of the Kyiv area and out of other areas. What they do in terms of refit, resupply, and then reentry into Ukraine, that remains to be seen, whether that will make a bigger difference in their ability to make the Donbas the priority that they see it is going to be.

That they have said that and that we are seeing indications that they are beginning to actualize that priority, to actually put effort into it, could mean that this could be a lengthy, more drawn out conflict, that they are now going to sort of sharpen their focus on one geographic area, not so much in other places. It could be a harbinger of a longer, more prolonged conflict here, as you know, the Russians try to gain some leverage, gain some progress, and perhaps gain some chips at the bargaining table.

Q: So if they're essentially reducing their battlefield objectives to the east of -- to eastern Ukraine, why would that augur a long, drawn out conflict?

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Because it's been a conflict that -- it's been fought over now for eight years. The Ukrainians know the territory very, very well, they have a lot of forces still there, and they're absolutely fighting very hard for that area, as they have over the last eight years. It's been a hot war there for eight years.

So just because they're going to prioritize it and put more force there or more energy there doesn't mean it's going to be easy for them.

Sylvie from AFP?

Q: Hello, I wanted to ask a question about Kherson. You said a few days ago that the Ukrainians were launching a counter-offensive there. Do you see any progress for the Ukrainians? And is the city still in control of the Russians?

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: We assess that there's still fighting over Kherson that we consider, we know the Russians are in the city, but we aren't prepared to call it for one side or the other at this point. I mean, it had been in Russian control, but the Ukrainians are, you know, are attempting to retake Kherson, so it's still fought over.

Q: Okay.

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Fadi?

Q: I have two questions. Just to understand the type of effort the Russians are putting into the Donbas area, and in light of this repositioning away from Kyiv, in terms of -- and I understand that you've been refraining from giving us specific numbers of troops around certain areas, but how what's the percentage of Russian forces that are dedicated in the Donbas area, to be able to understand whether the additional forces potentially may make any difference?

And then on the number that you mentioned of the air sorties from the Russian forces, you said over 300 in the last 24 hours. In comparison to previous days, is this a significant increase? And were the Ukrainians able to challenge these sorties or keep contesting the Russian airpower? Thank you.

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: The air sorties have -- for the Russians have -- kind of varied over the last few days, Fadi, to be honest with you. What we're seeing today is roughly consistent with what we saw yesterday. But you know, two, three days ago it was reduced. It was less than -- it was about half of what we're seeing now. So it -- you know, it's going to change from day to day. We'll do the best we can to tell you what we're seeing, but I'm going to refrain from trying to, you know, explain it or justify it. I can't do that. But it's roughly in keeping with what we saw yesterday, and what we saw yesterday was -- was significantly more than what we saw the day before. Late last week, they were up between, you know, depending on the day, between 250 and 340 sorties a day. So I mean, it varies. It varies on what they decide that they're going to -- what missions they're going to fly and how many planes they want to put in the air. Again, I don't have perfect insight into the Russians' air operations plan.

I do not have a firm number of troops that they have in the Donbas. As you know, we have scrupulously avoided trying to get into getting -- you know, just describing in great detail their order of battle. All I can tell you is that we believe that they are going -- that they are interested in reinforcing what they have there. Now, how they do that, how many, when, we don't have perfect visibility. What I can only go so far as what we know, and what we know and I believe was put out yesterday is we know Wagner is going to -- is trying to -- to reinforce the -- their presence in the Donbas. Again, this is not new for them. They have long had private military contractors in the Donbas, so it's not shocking to us that they would consider adding to that capability. But we haven't in any significant number of, you know, them moving forces there. We're going to -- we'll watch. We'll see what they do here with this repositioning, and where these folks go. We just don't know that yet. We're kind of watching it in real time, same as you.

Idrees?

Q: Hey, if I could just go back to Tom's question about the declassified intel, I was -- I was a bit confused when it came out, because it is sort of hard for me to believe that Putin wouldn't be aware of the difficulties in Ukraine, given that they've publicly announced a shift. They've acknowledged some casualties. I mean, it's probably a stupid question, but can't he just go on the Internet and, like, Google ""Kyiv"" and see everything pretty much, okay, easily? Why doesn't he, like -- you know, his advisors to be telling him stuff when he could easily see it? And how do we know this just sort -- isn't an attempt to explain his stubbornness and his approach to the war so far?

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Idrees, I can't speak to Mr. Putin's Internet habits or what -- what he decides to go look for or not look for. What I would tell you is that our assessment is that the planning for this war was done with a very small circle of people, and that Mr. Putin's advisors do not count many, and I, you know -- our assessment is that they have not been completely honest with him about -- about how it's going. I can't go into any more detail than that because it is an intelligence assessment, but that's what we believe, that he's kept a very close circle around him. It’s not a very inclusive leadership style, and that that necessarily winnows down the channels of communication that a leader has available to him. I can't account for the fact that the people advising him have -- have chosen to obstruct certain information or omit certain information. All we can say is we don't believe that he has been getting the full picture.

Tara Copp?

Q: Good morning. My cat is not on this call this time.

I wanted to get back to the intelligence. So the -- the reports of the Russians, you know, accidentally shooting down their own aircraft, they weren't really reports; it was the head of British spy services saying that. And so I just wanted to ask you about intelligence sharing between, you know -- obviously, U.K.'s one of the closest allies for intelligent sharing. Is there any disconnect going on there, or is it just that the Pentagon has not fully assessed that intelligence from the British?

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: I mean, obviously, we have a -- have a very close intelligence-sharing relationship with the Brits, as you know. I will share with you what we're comfortable sharing. Just because I'm not saying it doesn't mean we don't know it or have some visibility on something. I'm only going to share with you what I'm comfortable sharing with you, and I will go no further. But you shouldn't read into that that we don't have a great relationship with the Brits, or that we have an exceptionally-close intelligence-sharing process with them. And I'm not going to speak for what another nation decides to speak to. I can only speak to what the Department of Defense is willing to speak to, and that's as far as I'm going to go on any given day. So I think that's the best I can do to answer that question.

Q: Okay, thank you.

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Yup.

Nancy?

Q: Thank you. I'd like to follow up on something we discussed last week. Could you tell us your latest assessment on the Russian use of its navy in the Sea of Azov? Are their ships, the ones that are out to sea, able to pose a threat to places like the Donbas, or do you believe that Russia is currently repositioning its naval force much as it's done around the capital, to eventually pose a threat to the Donbas? Thank you.

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: So we have not seen a lot of naval activity in the Black Sea or Sea of Azov in the last few days. Right now, we assess that they've got three ships in the Sea of Azov. We assess that they're surface combatants. We know that they have some landing ships, as well, not in the Sea of Azov right now but in the Black Sea, as well as other surface combatants.

So, I mean, they're active in the region, they're active in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, but we just haven't seen anything that points to an imminent amphibious landing or another kind of assault. We haven't even seen them make fresh attempts to resupply, as they were doing when they lost that one LST in Berdyans'k. But again, that's present tense, we'll see where it goes.

As for threats to the Donbas, I mean, geography would simply tell you that they could absolutely use surface combatants with cruise missile capability to threaten the Donbas.

We do assess that they have launched cruise missiles from ships at sea, in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, into Ukraine -- I couldn't tell you where they went, I don't have that level of detail -- but certainly, that would be an option available to them if they want to -- you know, to increase firepower in the Donbas, and again, they've done it before, they have that capability. I just can't point to a given missile launch and tell you well, you know, here's where it landed. We just don't have that level of information.

Q: Just so I'm clear, when you talked about missile launches from the sea, that is since they've had to move those ships out after the attack in Berdyans'k. Is that correct?

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: They have -- they have consistently -- throughout this conflict, Nancy, they have consistently launched missiles from ships at sea. It's been sporadic at times, more intense at others, but we know that they -- that they have launched missiles from -- from ships at sea. That’s not a new development and I couldn't tell you that, you know, since they lost the LST in Berdyans'k, you know, how many they've launched or even if they have. I just don't have that level of detail. But it has been consistent throughout the beginning of this invasion that they have used ships at sea to launch missiles into Ukraine.

Q: Okay, thank you.

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Yeah. Alex Horton?

Q: Hey, I just wanted to echo my disappointment that we don't have a readout of Putin's browser history, but maybe that's a good thing.

I wanted to go back to Mariupol. And, you know, at the top of the call, when you rattled off the few places that, you know, were the focus of airstrikes, Mariupol wasn't on that list, and then a few minutes ago, you added it. So I just wanted to clarify if you would say that Mariupol is on that list of where the Russians are prioritizing airstrikes?

And second, if you've been able to assess if the humanitarian ceasefire that's there -- has that had any effect of Russian shelling or airstrikes?

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: I'm sorry, can you say the second one again?

Q: Yeah. I mean, since the humanitarian ceasefire -- it seems like it was agreed on by both sides in Mariupol, have you been able to assess any different or lessening of airstrikes or -- or shelling or has that continued as it has been?

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: I left Mariupol off as an oversight but I don't have, you know, again, this is where we get into, you know, actual time sensitivity here. I don't have an update on the degree to which a ceasefire is being applied in Mariupol.

What I try to give you is what we've seen, you know, in the last 24 hours, since we last talked, and we have continued to see Mariupol come under airstrikes. So I didn't mean anything by leaving them off, just an honest mistake there.

But as for what the ceasefire has done or will do, I just -- I don't have an update on it.

Q: Okay, thank you.

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Yeah. Mike Glenn?

Q: Thanks -- thank you. I just want to quickly -- so I was wondering if you can comment on these concerns from legislators up on the Hill, Democrat and Republican, who have raised questions about the pace of the supply effort to the Ukrainians? They say it's seems to be a little slow. I'm sure you saw this --

(CROSSTALK)

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: There's nothing slow about the pace. I mean, we -- we -- we sent $350 million of security assistance to Ukraine in not this last package but the one before that, in about three weeks, which is unprecedented, never been done that fast. And of the $800 million that the President has just recently signed out, that's already on its way.

As I've said, there's already been four to five flights -- shipments of that material and -- hang on a second, I'm looking at a chart right now -- let's see. So just to give you an example -- so that $800 million, it was signed out on the 16th of March, the execute order was released the very next day, and the first delivery arrived on the 20th, so four days after the President signed it. That's fast for any measure by which we -- by which we are doing that.

It's the same basic timeframe for the $200 million that the President signed out at -- right before that, signed out -- signed on the 12th, first delivery on the 18th. So very consistent with that. And we expect that we'll be able to finish the delivery of the $800 million by the middle of April, so roughly two weeks from now.

I don't know -- I don't know how anyone can describe that as anything other than expeditious and aggressive.

Ryo?

Q: Thank you. I want to ask you about China. Press Secretary Kirby said yesterday there is no indication of China's military support to Russia. Do you see any indications that China has decided not to provide military support to Russia?

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: I haven't seen any indications at this point that there's been Chinese military assistance provided to Russia with respect to this invasion.

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: Carla Babb, VOA?

Last question.

Q: Hey, thank you so much for doing this. I just, first of all, wanted to follow up, when you said that there have been an increase in sorties. You said there have been over 300 Russian sorties.

Is there -- are there any indications that you guys have gotten as to why there's an increase of these sorties recently?

Is it just to help provide cover for people as they're moving, or is it just an increase of offensives -- if you can give us a context there?

And then my -- my last question is, what's the level of concern that Russia might start using tactical nuclear weapons?

Is that a red line that you guys consider -- or do you consider that to be a red line?

SENIOR DEFENSE OFFICIAL: We haven't seen any activity by the Russians that would change our assessment or our strategic deterrent posture, and no indications at this time that they're preparing to use those kinds of weapons.

As for the sorties, again, Carla, I said this earlier, I can't speak to the Russian air plan. I can't tell you where they're all taking off from, how long they're flying, what munitions they're carrying with them, and where the munitions are being dropped.

We just don't have that level of granularity. I'm just trying to give you what I know I can give you. And what I can tell you is, over the last 24 hours, they've flown about 300 sorties. That is not inconsistent with yesterday, and it's not inconsistent with the several days late last week.

It does change from day to day. And there's going to be some days, quite frankly, folks, where I'm not going to have the number for you. I mean, our knowledge stream changes day to day. So if it's something I'm comfortable giving you, I'll give it to you. But -- but, as I said earlier, if I'm not comfortable, I'm not going to provide it. Because I don't want to be wrong. And I'll just do the best I can, but the only -- the only thing that I would say in answer to your question is, they have -- they have not stopped air strikes.

Even as they claim they're relocating and destabilize -- or, you know, de-escalating, they continue to hit Kyiv with air strikes. They continue to hit Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Mariupol -- and, of course, in that joint forces operations area.

So, I mean -- and you don't need me to tell you that. You guys can see it for yourselves in the imagery coming out of Ukraine and from many of your colleagues who are on the ground. Air strikes continue.

And so, as I said earlier, the other day, the talk of de-escalation, and ""We're pulling back because we want to give some oxygen to the talks,"" that's very nice rhetoric. But it doesn't mean that Kyiv is any under any less threat from the air. It continues to get pounded.

So we think that part of these, part of these sorties are designed to continue the pressure on Ukraine from the air, even as they depressurize, you know, the ground presence around Kyiv. They're still putting pressure on the Ukrainians from -- from the air.

It also could be of a piece of their desire to put more priority on the Donbas area. Because we do continue to see a lot of kinetic activity there, both from the ground and from the air. But as to exactly the breakdown of how many sorties are going to what places are where they're dropping, again, I just don't have that level of fidelity.

Okay, thanks, everybody. That does it for today. 
","Against this background, US intelligence officials concluded Russia was not doing anything to prepare
for using nuclear weapons. There had not been “any activity by the Russians that would change [the
US] assessment or ... strategic deterrence posture,” a senior US Pentagon official stated in a March 31

2022-04-01,"The US successfully tested a hypersonic missile in mid-March but kept it quiet for two weeks to avoid escalating tensions with Russia as President Joe Biden was about to travel to Europe, according to a defense official familiar with the matter.

The Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC) was launched from a B-52 bomber off the west coast, the official said, in the first successful test of the Lockheed Martin version of the system. A booster engine accelerated the missile to high speed, at which point the air-breathing scramjet engine ignited and propelled the missile at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5 and above.

The official offered scant details of the missile test, only noting the missile flew above 65,000 feet and for more than 300 miles. But even at the lower end of hypersonic range – about 3,800 miles per hour – a flight of 300 miles is less than 5 minutes.

The test came days after Russia says it used its own hypersonic missile during its invasion of Ukraine, claiming it targeted an ammunition warehouse in western Ukraine.

US officials downplayed the significance of the Russian use of their hypersonic Kinzhal missile. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he did not view it as “some sort of game changer” after the Russians announced the missile launch. Days later, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said it was “hard to know what exactly the justification” was for the launch, since it targeted a stationary storage facility.

“That’s a pretty significant sledgehammer to take out a target like that,” Kirby said at the time.

The Kinzhal missile is simply an air-launched version of the Russian Iskander short-range ballistic missile. In other words, it is a variation of an established technology as opposed to a revolution in hypersonic weaponry. The US test was of a more sophisticated and difficult air-breathing scramjet engine. The HAWC missile also has no warhead, instead relying on its kinetic energy to destroy the target.

At the time of the US test, Biden was preparing for a visit to NATO allies in Europe, including a stop in Poland where he met with Ukraine’s foreign minister and defense minister.

The US has been careful not to take steps or make statements that could unnecessarily escalate the tensions between Washington and Moscow. On Friday, the US canceled a test of the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to avoid any misinterpretation by Russia. Austin had already postponed the test in early March to avoid any actions that could be misconstrued by Russia at such a sensitive time.

In general, the US has also remained somewhat discreet about the weapons and equipment it sends into Ukraine. Only in the latest $300 million security assistance package did the Defense Department list specific systems and weapons.

The US has also opposed the transfer of fighter aircraft to Ukraine through the United States, concerned that the Kremlin could interpret such a move as the US and NATO entering the conflict in Ukraine.

US officials remained quiet about this latest hypersonic test for two weeks for similar reasons, the defense official said, careful not to provoke the Kremlin or President Vladimir Putin, especially as Russian forces expanded their bombardment of Ukraine.

The US test is the second successful test of a HAWC missile, and it is the first of the Lockheed Martin version of the weapon. Last September, the Air Force tested the Raytheon HAWC, powered by a Northrop Grumman scramjet engine.

The test met all primary objectives, according to a press release from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), including the missile’s integration and release, safe separation from the launch aircraft, booster firing, and cruise. Then too officials offered few details about the flight, with no mention of how fast the missile flew or what distance it traveled. The release only stated that the missile traveled at speeds greater than Mach 5.

The US has placed a renewed emphasis on hypersonic weapons following successful Russian and Chinese tests in recent months, exacerbating the concern in Washington that the US is falling behind on a military technology considered critical for the future.

In the FY23 defense budget, the Biden administration has requested $7.2 billion for long range fires, including hypersonic missiles. In a report last year, the Government Accountability Office identified 70 efforts related to the development of hypersonic weapons, expected to cost nearly $15 billion between 2015 and 2024.

One month after the first successful HAWC test, the US suffered a setback when the test of a different hypersonic system failed. The failure came just as reports emerged that China had successfully tested a hypersonic glide vehicle over the summer and shortly after Russia claimed to have successfully tested its submarine-launched hypersonic missile, dubbed the Tsirkon.","Nevertheless, the US military took no chances and on April 1 canceled the initially postponed test of a
Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile. According to US Air Force spokeswoman Ann
Stefanek, this decision “was due to the same reasons as when it had been first delayed.” The Air
Force was “confident in the readiness of the strategic forces of the United States,” Stefanek
stressed.
147 On the same day, a US defense official acknowledged that Washington had also kept a successful hypersonic missile test from mid-March under wraps to prevent further escalation with Russia"," Pentagon cancels Minuteman III test.

2022-04-07,"We, the G7 Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, condemn in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces in Bucha and a number of other Ukrainian towns. Haunting images of civilian deaths, victims of torture, and apparent executions, as well as reports of sexual violence and destruction of civilian infrastructure show the true face of Russia’s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine and its people. The massacres in the town of Bucha and other Ukrainian towns will be inscribed in the list of atrocities and severe violations of international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights, committed by the aggressor on Ukrainian soil.

In the presence of the Foreign Minister of Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba, we expressed today our heart-felt solidarity with the Ukrainian people and our deepest condolences to the victims of this war and their families. We underline our unwavering support for Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders and express our readiness to assist further, including with military equipment and financial means, to allow Ukraine to defend itself against Russia’s aggression and to rebuild Ukraine.

We underscore that those responsible for these heinous acts and atrocities, including any attacks targeting civilians and destruction of civilian infrastructure, will be held accountable and prosecuted. We welcome and support the ongoing work to investigate and gather evidence of these and other potential war crimes and crimes against humanity, including by the ICC Office of the Prosecutor, the Commission of Inquiry mandated by the UN Human Rights Council, the Human Rights Monitoring Mission Ukraine of the OHCHR, and the OSCE’s mission of experts mandated by OSCE Participating States. We will provide investigative support, technical experts and funding. We will continue to promote accountability for all those complicit in Moscow’s war of choice, including the Lukashenka regime in Belarus. We are convinced that now is the time to suspend Russian membership of the Human Rights Council.

Russia must immediately comply with the legally binding order of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to suspend the military operations that it commenced on 24 February 2022 in the territory of Ukraine. Further, we urge Russia to withdraw completely its military forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.

We warn against any threat or use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. We recall Russia’s obligations under international treaties of which it is a party, and which protect us all. Any use by Russia of such a weapon would be unacceptable and result in severe consequences. We condemn Russia’s unsubstantiated claims and false allegations against Ukraine, a respected member of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention that is in compliance with its legal obligations under those instruments. We express concern about other countries and actors that have amplified Russia’s disinformation campaign.

We express our gravest concern with Russia forcefully seizing control of nuclear facilities, and other violent actions in connection with a number of nuclear facilities, nuclear and other radioactive material, which have caused and continue to pose serious and direct threats to the safety and security of these facilities and their civilian personnel, significantly raising the risk of a nuclear accident or incident, which endangers the population of Ukraine, neighboring States and the international community.

We reiterate our demand that Russia upholds its obligations under international humanitarian law and desists from further blatant abuses. The Russian leadership must immediately provide for safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access and make safe passages work, enabling humanitarian aid to be delivered to besieged cities and civilians to reach safety.

We commit to supporting the Government of Ukraine’s humanitarian coordination structure and to disburse humanitarian support quickly. We ask others to join in this effort. A humanitarian push including more funding is urgently needed for Ukraine and beyond as Russia’s ruthless war and actions are having massive consequences on global commodity and food prices. The resulting rise in food insecurity is being felt disproportionately by the most vulnerable. We stand in solidarity with our partners across the world who have to bear the rising price of President Putin’s unilateral choice to wage war in Europe. We will make coherent use of all instruments and funding mechanisms to address food insecurity, keep markets open, and build resilience in the agriculture sector on all continents. We will actively counter Russia’s narrative that Western sanctions have caused the rise in global food prices and call it out for what it is: a blatant lie.

In light of Russia’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine, carried out with Belarus’ complicity, we have already adopted unprecedented and coordinated economic and financial sanctions against Russia that impose a significant cost on its economy. We stress the necessity of further increasing the economic pressure inflicted on Russia and the Lukashenka regime in Belarus. Together with international partners, the G7 will sustain and increase pressure on Russia by imposing coordinated additional restrictive measures to effectively thwart Russian abilities to continue the aggression against Ukraine. We will work together to stop any attempts to circumvent sanctions or to aid Russia by other means. We are taking further steps to expedite plans to reduce our reliance on Russian energy, and will work together to this end.

We commend those neighboring states to Ukraine that demonstrated great solidarity and humanity by welcoming Ukrainian refugees and third country nationals affected by the conflict. We confirm the need for increased international assistance and will continue to support these countries, including by receiving more refugees. President Putin’s war of aggression against Ukraine has already forced millions of civilians, especially women, children, and elderly, to flee their homes. Over 4.2 million crossed the border to other countries, almost all of them to the EU and the Republic of Moldova. We reiterate our concern about the risk to this vulnerable population, including the risk of human trafficking and our commitment to protect these refugees.

Ministers paid special attention to the Republic of Moldova, which hosts the largest group of refugees from Ukraine per capita. The Ministers agreed to further coordinate their assistance for Moldova’s humanitarian response and long-term resilience following the Moldova Support Conference co-hosted by Germany, France and Romania on 5 April in Berlin and the establishment of the Moldova Support Platform.

2022-04-14,"WASHINGTON — The director of the C.I.A. said on Thursday that “potential desperation” to extract the semblance of a victory in Ukraine could tempt President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to order the use of a tactical or low-yield nuclear weapon, publicly discussing for the first time a concern that has coursed through the White House during seven weeks of conflict.

The director, William J. Burns, who served as American ambassador to Russia and is the member of the administration who has dealt most often with Mr. Putin, said the potential detonation of such a weapon — even as a warning shot — was a possibility that the United States remained “very concerned” about. But he quickly cautioned that so far, despite Mr. Putin’s frequent invocation of nuclear threats, he had seen no “practical evidence” of the kinds of military deployments or movement of weapons that would suggest such a move was imminent.

“Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they’ve faced so far, militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons,” Mr. Burns said during a question-and-answer session following a speech he delivered at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

He spoke in response to a question from former Senator Sam Nunn, of Georgia, who helped create the program that brought nuclear weapons out of Ukraine and other former Soviet states 30 years ago.

Tactical weapons are sometimes called “battlefield nukes,” smaller weapons that can be shot out of a mortar or even exploded like a mine, as opposed to “strategic” weapons that are put on intercontinental ballistic missiles. Russia has a large arsenal of tactical weapons; the United States keeps comparatively few. Low-yield nuclear weapons have been designed to produce a fairly small explosion, which sometimes blurs the difference between conventional and nuclear weapons.

Mr. Burns also argued that the disclosure of Mr. Putin’s intentions by U.S. intelligence officials before the outbreak of the war had made it harder for Mr. Putin to hide the “raw brutality” his forces have used in Ukraine, reminiscent of the damage Russian forces inflicted in Chechnya in the 1990s.

“I have watched over the years as Putin has stewed in a combustible combination of grievance and ambition and insecurity,” Mr. Burns said. He said the Russian president has nursed grievances against the West for decades, convinced the United States took advantage of Russia’s weakness after the breakup of the Soviet Union.

President Biden and his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, both acknowledged Thursday that the White House was debating sending a high-level official to Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, in a show of support for the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain recently took a secret trip to Kyiv by train.

Mr. Sullivan said that the White House had briefly considered having Mr. Biden go into Ukraine, but as soon as it became clear “what kind of footprint that would require, what kind of assets that would take from the Ukrainians as well as the U.S.” to keep him safe, the idea was rejected.

When pressed on reports that he, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken or Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III might go to Kyiv, Mr. Sullivan declined to discuss it, saying that “if and when that happens, we want to make sure it’s done in a very secure way.” Mr. Biden told reporters no decision had been made to send an envoy.

Mr. Sullivan also said that in coming days the United States would announce a crackdown on countries and companies violating the Western sanctions on Moscow, imposed since the invasion began in late February.

The Commerce Department on Thursday identified 10 aircraft that were flying into or operated by Belarus, with the apparent intention of registering them in Russia. The sanctions would prevent servicing or fueling the aircraft internationally, effectively grounding them.

Mr. Sullivan had made a similar vow to crack down on violators just ahead of Mr. Biden’s trip to Brussels and Warsaw last month. But on Thursday, speaking at the Economic Club of Washington, he said he believed that some of the sanctions — particularly export controls on defense technology — were beginning to hurt Russia’s military readiness.

“Russia’s ability to retool and replenish,” he said, was being set back because many of its systems “rely on Western microchips and components.”

“They are exhausting the stock of some of the high-end weapons,” Mr. Sullivan added, though he acknowledged that the continuing purchase of natural gas from Russia was helping to fund the war.

“I’m not sitting here suggesting we have so starved them of those resources they literally can’t field an army and continue to try to make progress on the battlefield,” Mr. Sullivan said. But he said Washington was stepping up the effort to help Europe wean itself off Russian gas by delivering supplies of liquefied natural gas from the United States.

But Mr. Sullivan also indicated that so far he had seen no evidence that China was stepping in to help Mr. Putin with either military or financial aid. His statement was notable because Mr. Biden, in a call with President Xi Jinping of China four weeks ago, had warned about American penalties should China aid the war effort. But the evidence since then has suggested that despite Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi’s declaration in February that their relationship has “no limits,” China in fact appears to be of mixed views on how much to support the war.

Mr. Burns and Mr. Sullivan both acknowledged that the war was moving to a new phase now that Russia appears to have narrowed its objective to taking the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russia separatists have been fighting since 2014.

Gen. Philip Breedlove, the former supreme allied commander in Europe, who is now retired, said Thursday that while Mr. Putin may be able to paint his narrower operation as a win, the war will be a loss for Russia in the long term.

“Ukraine is still going to try to fight what I call the American Revolutionary War again, skirmishing and counterattacking and ambushing,” General Breedlove said. “It is just going to be a lot harder for them.”

By moving his forces to the east, Mr. Putin is looking to move the war to more favorable territory, trying to make it more difficult for the Ukrainian forces to stick with those tactics. “They are now prepared to fight the war that they really want,” General Breedlove said. “They want to meet force on force in open fields.”

","Meanwhile on the same day, April 14, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director William Burns put
into perspective nuclear escalation concerns. Asked about his agency’s risk assessment of a possible
use of tactical nuclear weapons, he explained that though the situation had to be taken seriously, no
“practical evidence” indicated Russian preparations for such a scenario.
President Biden is deeply concerned about avoiding a third world war, about avoiding a threshold in which ... nuclear conflict becomes possible. ... Russian military doctrine holds that you
could escalate to de-escalate. ... Some Russian leaders have talked about a circumstance in
which … NATO would intervene militarily on the ground in Ukraine. ... That’s not something, as
President Biden has made very clear, that’s in the cards, but … given the potential desperation of
President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they’ve faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons
or low-yield nuclear weapons. … While we’ve seen some rhetorical posturing on the part of the
Kremlin about moving to higher nuclear alert levels, so far we haven’t seen a lot of practical evidence of the kind of deployments or … military dispositions that would … reinforce that concern.
But we watch for that very intently. 2","Burns: Putin’s threats must be taken seriously, but so far there
are no alarming indications.

2022-04-19,"PRESS SECRETARY JOHN F. KIRBY: Afternoon, everybody. OK. I think earlier you saw today that the secretary had a phone call with the Spanish minister of defense -- thank you -- Margarita Robles to discuss security assistance for Ukraine. He thanked the minister for Spanish contributions to NATO's eastern flank and Spanish security assistance that has been provided to Ukraine. He also noted that allied support is making a difference in terms of the battlefield progress for the Ukrainians and who continue to fight courageously to defend the country. And, of course, the leaders agreed to stay in touch and we'll have a fuller readout later. 

I also want to note scheduling-wise, the secretary will be welcoming his Polish counterpart here at the building tomorrow for a bilateral meeting, of course, focused on Ukraine. And then again on Thursday with his Czech counterpart here in the building for another bilat discussion, again, focused very much so, not only on our relationships with these individual countries but, of course, what is going on in Ukraine. And obviously we'll provide you readout information of those. 

OK. With that, we'll go to questions. Bob. 

Q: Thank you, John. I just wonder if you can give any update on the status of the plans for training in Europe or Ukrainians on the howitzers and radars and some of the other items from this latest package. And also I know you're just getting started on that latest package, but is there room -- in Secretary Austin's mind, is there room to expand even further the kinds of assistance that can be given to Ukraine that would be suitable for this new offensive that the Russians are conducting in the Donbas? 

MR. KIRBY: So, a couple of thoughts there. I don't have any updates for you on the -- on the training, on the howitzer training. But there is a -- there is a plan in place and we're beginning to execute that -- that plan to get that the training done. Again, it will be for a fairly limited amount of -- of Ukrainian trainers that will then go in and -- and train their colleagues. It will be outside the country. But right now we're just not in a position where we can sort of detail a lot of this. But there -- but the plan is in place and we expect to be able to get that training accomplished very, very soon, in a matter of -- of -- of days.

And again, I -- I think we'll be able to have more -- more to talk about a little bit later in the week on that. And as for what's in the -- the drawdown package I think, you know, you saw we detailed all the items that are going into that. And that -- and we're -- and we're focused right now on sourcing those items.

On the Howitzers specifically, I think that you'll see them move very, very soon. I don't have any shipments to speak to today but I think that you'll see them move very, very soon as well as the -- the ammunition that goes with them.

And as I -- I think I said yesterday, you know, we've -- we've definitely sourced the 18, we know where they're coming from. It's really just a matter now of -- of getting them packaged up and getting them on the way. They'll be coming from the United States, and, again, I think it's -- it's really very, very soon, matter of -- matter of days here.

And same for the ammunition, we believe we'll be able to pull virtually all of that out of pre-positioned stocks that are already in Europe, so it won't take very long to get the artillery rounds where they need to -- where they need to go. And as for the other systems, I don't have any specific training scenarios to speak to with respect to the -- the two radars, the two portable radar -- radar systems that we are providing Ukraine.

Again, we don't believe that in those cases that there's -- there's going to be any -- anywhere near an onerous training process for that. These are counter artillery radar, and a portable air defense radar system, the Sentinel, which you tow behind a vehicle.

It's -- it's not equipment that the Ukrainians intrinsically know how to use but we don't believe it's going to take very long to get them -- the proper familiarization. I just don't have any plans on that to talk about.

Q: My other questions was about whether you're considering a wider array of weaponry or other kinds of support beyond this?

MR. KIRBY: For this pack -- for this package that we're working on now, we're working on the systems we already announced that are part of that. And to answer, I think to answer your question, they are exactly the kinds of systems the Ukrainians have been asking for and they are tailored and designed -- the things that we're giving them tailored and designed for the fight that we know they're in now in the Donbas and -- and will be in coming days and weeks.

So I mean, artillery -- the -- the radar systems, the coastal defense unmanned systems that we're talking about. As well as, again, continued deliveries of small arms and ammunition. Which I know doesn't get the attention of everybody but it is still a vital, vital contribution in terms of the security assistance packages we've been providing.

Since the invasion, we have helped deliver, not just from our stocks but from stocks of other nations, more than 50 million rounds of small arms ammunition of various calibers -- 50 million. And that's the kind of stuff that the Ukrainians are literally using every single day since this invasion began.

So all of that will also be factored into these -- this package going forward.

Q: One last thing. What I was trying to get at was the Ukrainians are also asking for other things beyond that? I mean, I'm talking about tanks, aircraft. And I know you've talked about this before but are -- are you reconsidering any of those type of things?

MR. KIRBY: It's not about reconsidering, Bob, I mean, they -- they have -- they have received tanks from other nations. I mean, the kinds of tanks that they know how to use are not the tanks that we have in our -- in our inventory. But other nations have provided some -- some tanks.

Some nations have provided spare parts so that they can get their inoperable tanks operable again. And I would say the same on -- on aircraft. I mean, they have received support on -- for -- for -- to -- to get some of their fixed-wing aircraft, you know, more operable again. So I mean, look, the proof’s in the pudding there.

I mean, they right now have available to them more fixed-wing fighter aircraft than they did two weeks ago. And that's not by accident, that's because other nations who have experience with those kinds of aircraft have been able to help them get -- get more aircraft up -- up and running.

So the short answer to I guess the question that I three times failed to answer, but the short answer is -- is yes, we're working with the Ukrainians every day on -- on helping them with those other systems. And if it's a system that we can procure for them or get to them, we're -- we're doing that.

And certainly, if it's one that -- that we can pull down from our own stocks that's largely what drawdown authority’s all about. But in the case where it's not that, we are working with allies and partners who do have access to whether it is spare parts or whole systems to be able to -- to be able to get that into Ukraine for their use.

Q: Thank you.

MR. KIRBY: Yeah. Carla.

Q: Thank you. First of all, when -- if the U.S. were to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism how would that affect the Pentagon's communications with the Russian military? Like would there still be a line of communication available? Can you go into that? I know that the U.S. has not yet designated but if they did...

MR. KIRBY: So I'm wondering why -- why the question because there's -- there's not an active discussion about doing that.

Q: There isn't? I thought that the U.S. was taking a look at it though?

MR. KIRBY: I -- I know nothing out of the DOD that says we're -- we're talking about doing that.

Q: But the State Department had said...

MR. KIRBY: Well, I -- I can't speak for the State Department. But I'm not -- I -- I don't know of any effort here at DOD to -- to do that. So what effect that might have I'm not going to speculate.

Q: OK. And then if you would, can you give us an update on the Pentagon's assistance on collecting evidence for war crime accusations? How's that going?

MR. KIRBY: We are -- we are part of a larger interagency effort that is helping to provide documentation and -- and -- and evidence to -- to -- to support what we have long believed. Our -- our credible claims of war crimes by Russian forces but it's not just the DOD, the -- the whole administration, at least the agencies that have the wherewithal to provide evidence whether that's imagery or -- or other data that -- that can help support war crimes investigations, we're contributing to that. Yes.

Q: Hi, John. On the Howitzers, is there a sense that they -- the Ukrainians will quickly need additional artillery rounds and that the U.S. is going to send 40,000 but if they have a sustained fight, you could go through those 40,000 pretty quickly. How open is the door to quickly getting more artillery rounds?

MR. KIRBY: I think, you know, we've said many times it's about supporting Ukraine as much as we can as fast as we can. And while I don't have any future shipments to speak to today, I think you can assume that should there be additional need in the future for more 155 artillery rounds, the United States will be right at the front of the line doing what we can to help -- help get them there.

Q: And then on the -- the visits recently, Spain today, Poland...

MR. KIRBY: Spain was a phone call.

Q: ...okay Spain was a phone call, and then Poland tomorrow and Czechoslovakia. How much of the conversation now is about the future? And maybe having an increased U.S. troop presence in Europe because of the threat or is it very much still presently focused on Ukraine?

MR. KIRBY: Yeah. I think these discussions that the secretary's having and you've -- we've read them all out to you, you -- you can see how much and how deeply he's engaged with bilateral conversations with a whole range of allies and partners -- is focused on Ukraine, and what's going on right now, and what can all do as allies and partners to help support Ukraine's critical defense needs.

That's the focus right now. They're not having deep discussion about long-term European footprint and what that would look like. We are having initial discussions here in the building about long-term posture. It would be foolish for us not to given that we know the security environment in Europe has changed. 

But in terms of the detailed negotiations with other countries about where that footprint might be rotational versus permanent or what the size might be, we're just not there yet.

Q: Without bringing up any requests, are they broaching the topic at all with the secretary?

MR. KIRBY: I won't get into more detail in these conversations than what we're putting out in the readouts. But I don't want to leave you with the notion that -- that -- that deep negotiations and discussions about footprint is a predominant part of these discussions.

Does it come up coincidentally sometimes when he's talking, depends on the nation and their -- and their willingness to host U.S. forces, sure it does. But it's -- it's not -- they're not diving deep into that and -- and looking at the map and deciding where we're going to put troops and how long they're going to stay. That's just not part of the conversation right now.

Q: Some of the original units that were deployed in like February, March, to respond to Ukraine have been extended. Is the conversation now about extending those further or maybe bringing in rotating in a new group of troops and would that be more from active duty, or are you thinking about calling up Reservists or National Guardsmen to fill that?

MR. KIRBY: I don't know of plans to call up for Reservists or National Guard for these sorts of commitments. I don't have any additional decisions to talk to today in terms of extensions or redeployments.

It is something that the secretary routinely revisits with General Wolters. There's been some, obviously, decision to -- to not terminate deployments in the case of the 82nd, in the case of the Harry S. Truman.

But -- but, you know, if and when we have overt decision making to speak to we'll certainly do that. But there's been no change in that -- in that rotational footprint right now. Yes, Barb.

Q: A senior defense official earlier this morning talked about the notion that the Department did not see anything imminent, I think that was the officials words, in terms of the concerns about Russia's nuclear weapons.

Could you clarify a little bit more what this official was talking about? In other words, do you -- do you still have any concerns about Putin's threats about nuclear weapons or is it off the table? And in your mind, in the Departments mind is the secretary continuing to get briefed on the status of Russia's nuclear weapons? 

How much of a focus is this for him as he continues to get briefings over all of the situation?

MR. KIRBY: The Secretary is routinely kept abreast of -- of threats in the nuclear realm and that includes a regular interchange with the U.S. Strategic Command commander, Admiral Richard. It is something that we monitor virtually every day, particularly in light of -- of the escalatory rhetoric that Mr. Putin voiced at the early days of this -- of this war.

I would just tell you without getting into too much classified information, that again, we monitor this every day. We have seen no reason to change our strategic deterrent posture and we're comfortable, remain comfortable that we have the ability, if required, to defend the Homeland, our allies and our partners with the current strategic deterrent posture that we have in place.

But it is not something that we ever take for granted, even before Mr. Putin decided to invade Ukraine, it's the kind of thing that we're constantly monitoring. I mean that is a -- you know it's a --

Q: Would you say that the Secretary is monitoring that the Russia situation has perhaps, I don't know, stepped up, increased since the invasion after Putin's rhetoric?

MR. KIRBY: I think clearly we took note of what Mr. Putin said in the early days of this invasion. I think it's also important to add that there hasn't been a lot more of that rhetoric following that initial salvo in the early days. But -- but yes, look, in light of what's going in Ukraine, and certainly in light of the early rhetoric, we are actively monitoring every single day.

And even today -- and even today the secretary remains comfortable that we have an appropriate strategic deterrent posture in place and there's no need to make any changes to it.

Q:  A quick follow-up on a different subject going back to Bob's very first question, I think. You said that you have a training plan for the artillery and that you were beginning to execute it, so can we conclude from that the training has begun?

MR. KIRBY: No, you cannot.

Q: Why not?

MR. KIRBY: Because it hasn't.

Q: The training has not begun?

MR. KIRBY: No.

Q: OK, thank you.

MR. KIRBY: But I think we'll be making progress here in very short order. Tom?

Q: Thanks, John. Good afternoon. Two questions please. On the unmanned coastal defense weapons that are being sent over, without getting into any security details, are there mechanisms to prevent them from -- if they're captured by the Russians -- by the Russians being able to reverse engineer them? That's my first question.

MR. KIRBY: I don't even know how I could answer that question. I mean we're -- we're -- we're going to give these capabilities to the Ukrainians so that they can use them to help defend their coast.

That's our focus, that's our attention right now. I'm not going to talk about a hypothetical capture by the Russians and what that would do or what that would mean.

Q: OK. I'm -- well, correct me, might be something that happens, a hypothetical in war time you --

MR. KIRBY: I know, Tom, but we could -- we could hypothesize all day about things that haven't happened and might happen and I'm just -- I just don't want to -- I don't think that's a good use of our time.

Q: OK. How about this one, my second question. In the inventory that we're sending over, how many systems like the Howitzers or artillery are close enough for the Ukrainians to train on and how many things do we have like you just mentioned, like the tanks, our tanks are not even near what they could do. Would you say most of the stuff we send over the Ukrainians can use without training or how would it --

MR. KIRBY: Yes.

Q: Yes, OK.

MR. KIRBY: Yes. I mean and that's been the case over now more than $3 billion worth of -- of material and assistance, the vast -- vast majority has required no additional training by Ukrainians.

I mean let's just take a look here. Right. We did a little bit of training on the Switchblade because that's not a UAV they know how to use. It's also not a very difficult one to use. We're going to get some training for a small number of Ukrainians on the Howitzers and the 155 artillery because they don't use that caliber and they don't -- they don't have in their stocks American Howitzers. 

But as I said the other day, artillery pieces are not all that radically different from one another and we don't think it's going to take very long for them to -- to go through the training on that. We're looking at to the degree to which we need to familiarize them with these radar systems, these portable radar systems that -- that we're going to flow over.

We don't have all that nailed down yet but we're looking at that. We also don't think that's going to require a whole heck of a lot of time. And we have already done some training with the Ukrainians that were here in the states before who got the Switchblade training also got training on -- on these coastal defense systems. 

So they are ready to receive those. We're doing the best we can to focus on, A, the kinds of capabilities we know they need and that they say they want and are using, B, secondary to that, to try to get them systems that they don't need a lot of start-up time for, that they can put in the field almost immediately.

And short of that, where we can't meet one or two to be able to provide some level of familiarization and/or training as required. But the -- but as I've said many times, we know that the -- that the -- time is not our friend and the clock is a bit of an enemy here too.
 
So I think we can be forgiven for wanting to make sure that we get stuff to them that they can use quickly and effectively in the field. And if there is a training component that we can -- that it can be as short as possible so that they're not distracted by the fight they're in in terms of training and education. 

Yes. 

Q: Thank you, John. In Ukraine, everyone's attention, everyone tells about the situation in Mariupol and the plans right now, and about Ukrainian military and possibly civilians blocked there. So, could you share your understanding of the situation there? And secondly...

MR. KIRBY: In Mariupol? 

Q: The Russia -- the strategy Russia might use there. 

MR. KIRBY: You're talking about Mariupol? 

Q: Yes, sir. 

MR. KIRBY: Look, you know, I'm careful not to detail battlefield tactic here because we're not on the ground, and so our visibility is quite frankly, somewhat limited. Our assessment is that Mariupol still remains contested, that the Russians have not taken it, that the Ukrainians are still fighting for it, that there has been a lot of devastation in Mariupol caused by the airstrike and the artillery strikes that the Russians continue to reign down on the city. 

The Ukrainians obviously want to keep Mariupol, and for good reason, it's their city. And they're fighting bravely for it. I'm not going to speculate about how much longer it will hold out, and frankly we're not willing to accept what some critics say is the inevitability of it falling. They didn't take Kyiv either, they didn't take Chernihiv, and the Ukrainians continue to fight over Mariupol.  

Now look, why the Russians want it -- again, I'm not inside the strategists' heads there in Moscow. But if you just look at geography you can see the importance of Mariupol to what the Russians themselves have said is a goal, which is a land bridge to Crimea from the Donbas down to Crimea as well as the ability to close off -- to pinch off Ukrainian forces in the Donbas. 

They've already said they're going to focus their efforts on the Donbas specifically, this is an area of the country that they have been fighting over for eight years, and the Russians have said themselves they're going to prioritize that. If that is your geographic goal, then there is a logic that follows that Mariupol could be important to that because it lies at the southern end of that part of Ukraine. 

OK, David. 

Q: Just before we came in here the wires were moving the stories that the president had just told reporters he was going to be sending more artillery. So I want to give you a chance to tell us more about that. But I also want to ask you, why is this being done in slices? If you knew when you did the 18 howitzers that wasn't going to be enough, why wait another week if, as you say, time is working against you? 

MR. KIRBY: Because time is working against us, David. I mean, so first of all a couple of things. One, everything we're sending is a result of iterative conversations that we're having with the Ukrainians, literally in real time about what they need and what we can provide. 

And we do the best we can with each package to tailor it to the need at the time, and now the need has changed, because now the war has changed, because now the Russians have prioritized the Donbas area and that's a whole different level of fighting, a whole different type of fighting. 

And last Wednesday was when the president announced $800 million to include 18 howitzers. And we never said at the time, David, and I'm not saying today -- and you heard the president himself today – that that's the end all, be all sum total of everything we're going to do. 

We have said, and we've acknowledged that fighting in the Donbas is going to require an effort for both sides on long-range fires, which means for both sides artillery. We've noticed that the Russians had moved in artillery support into Donbas, and it follows that the Ukrainians would want artillery support. 

I don't have any future packages or shipments to speak to today. You know that I'm not going to get ahead of that. But as I answered to Tara it is certainly within the realm of the possible that the Ukrainians will want additional artillery systems and additional artillery rounds, and we will have those conversations with them, and we will -- if that's the need, we'll do everything we can to meet it. 

Q: So last week the Ukrainians told United States we only need 18 howitzers...

MR. KIRBY: No. 

Q: ...only needed 40,000 rounds...

MR. KIRBY: No, no. They said they needed artillery support, and just like in every other package, we take a look at what capabilities they're asking for. What do we have immediately in the inventory that we can get there quickly? And what we came up with in this package was 18 howitzers and 40,000 rounds, but it doesn't mean it's the sum total. 

And to your question about why we're slicing this, I find that interesting because if we were to -- let's just say that we follow the alternative logic and at the very beginning of the invasion we just said here's everything -- everything in the shoebox let's just send it over there. Well, what if everything in the shoebox doesn't fit the fight that they're in. 

So you tailor each package based on the fight that they're in and what's going on at the time. You also have to tailor your packages, David, on what they can absorb on their end. I mean, it's -- they understand they have absorption issues too that they have to deal with. 

So you don't want to flow everything you've got -- the whole kitchen sink in there and then have them have nowhere to put them, nowhere to store them temporarily, nowhere to move them to and nowhere to put them in the fight. So you have to do this smartly, and this means doing it in chunks and phases based on what their needs are in the moment. It would be irresponsible for us not to do it that way. 

Sylvie.

Q: Hello, John. I have two questions. A European official said this morning that they could be up to 20,000 foreign fighters, and Wagner employees fighting for Russia in Ukraine. Is it a number you find plausible? 

MR. KIRBY: I have not seen that number. We know that the Russians have tried to recruit foreign fighters, particularly out of Syria. And the Wagner group we know also has been interested in pulling people from elsewhere like from North Africa. 

The Russians themselves said they were going to recruit 16,000 Syrians. We don't know whether they actually achieved that goal, or how close they got to it and how many foreign fighters there might be in Ukraine, we just don't have a good count. 

Q: And you said earlier that the Ukrainians have now more fighter aircraft than they had two weeks ago. Can you give us...

MR. KIRBY: More operable fighter aircraft than they had two weeks ago. 

Q: So can you give us an idea of – did they receive more? And an idea of how many? Dozens? 

MR. KIRBY: I would just say without getting into what other nations are providing that they have received additional platforms and parts to be able to increase their fleet size -- their aircraft fleet size, I think I'd leave it at that. 

Platforms and parts. 

Q: What is a platform?

MR. KIRBY: Platform is an airplane in this case. They have received additional aircraft and aircraft parts to help them, you know, get more aircraft in the air. Yes. 

Q: Thanks, John. I wanted to follow-up on U.S. security aid to Ukraine. I think you said the total was like $3 billion now. And the expectation would be that Congress is going to replenish those funds. Can you say where that it is? Like how much has been reimbursed so far? How much you're still looking to get back? And like do you have any specific timeline -

MR. KIRBY: I don't unfortunately. Not today. I'll try to take the question for you and get back to you on that. 

Nancy.

Q: Thank you. I just want to follow-up on a couple of earlier questions. David had asked you earlier about some comments the President made earlier today about more artillery --

MR. KIRBY: Yes.

Q: -- going to Ukraine, if you could provide some details about that? And then on the additional platforms --

MR. KIRBY: I thought I did. I thought my answer was pretty comprehensive, no?

Q: Really.

Q: I thought you didn’t either…

MR. KIRBY: You didn't think I did either?

Q: Provide details?

MR. KIRBY: Yes. 

Q: On the next package? 

MR. KIRBY: Yes.

Q: No.

MR. KIRBY: I told you I'm not going to do that. I specifically said I'm not going to get ahead of future announcements. Now look…

Q: It’s been announced, so is it a future announcement?

MR. KIRBY: Look we're constantly looking at what we can do to help the Ukrainians. I don't have any additional announcements to make today on any further drawdown packages. But I certainly would not rule out the possibility of additional drawdown package authorities being granted to the DoD to pull from our inventories. 

And it would -- I certainly wouldn't, as I said to Tara, if the Ukrainians desire more artillery support then we're going to do what we can to flow additional artillery support. But I'm not going to get ahead of decisions that haven't been announced. So I'd leave it at that.

Q: And can you clarify when you when you talked about additional platforms and parts were any of those provided or transported by the United States?

MR. KIRBY: No. I mean we -- I would say we certainly have helped with the -- with the transshipment of some additional spare parts that have helped with their aircraft needs. But we have not transported whole aircraft. Yes.

Q: Can you talk to us a little bit about any updates that you have visibility into the use of chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine? There have been some reports of just recently the last few days about the use of Sarin in Bilka perhaps. Evidence on the ground of ampoules and things like that.

MR. KIRBY: No. We don't have any indications that chemical or biological weapons have been used in Ukraine. 

Q: And what's the state of the PPE that was being sent over to them, the personal protective equipment, to help them in case of any sort of attack like that?

MR. KIRBY: It's part of -- it's part of this $800 million package that we are still working on, guys. I mean it only got announced on the 13th, the first shipment went in two days later. There are multiple shipments going. I'm not going to get into an inventory list on every given day of every article. But their personal protective equipment will be part of that $800 million. 

Yes, let me go to the phones here. I haven't gotten anybody. Idrees?

Q: Thanks, John. Over the past couple of days Russia and their Defense Ministry has made a couple of statements about them targeting western and U.S. weapons. Just wanted to check in. Have you seen any western or U.S. weapons hit in Ukraine by Russia? Or even targeted?

MR. KIRBY: Seen any -- we have no indications that any western equipment or shipments have been -- have been hit or deterred by the Russians. The strikes in Lviv, again we don't know exactly what the Russian targeting logic is here. We just can't get inside their heads on every airstrike that they are conducting. 

But it is possible that the strikes they conducted in Lviv were meant to try to affect inventory levels of material and weapons that the Ukrainians may have had. But I've got no confirmation to that. I'm not -- I don't -- I can't say for sure that that was what they were targeting. And we have no indication that any weapons or systems that we were sending in or other countries were sending in were hit or disrupted.

Courtney.

Q: You actually kind of answered it at the end there. But so you're saying that it's possible that the strikes in Lviv may -

MR. KIRBY: It's possible that that's what they were trying to do. But it is -- it's an open question whether it was successful, we have no indication that there's been any impact. 

Q: Is there any concern, I mean it's pretty remarkable at this point that they haven't actually been able to stop or deter any of these weapon shipments that we’ve heard about especially if they've been accelerating and there's a half dozen or whatever that are getting in a day or more. Is there -- is there a concern that that might be more of a goal for them in the days going forward and is there anything that's being done -

MR. KIRBY: It has been -- it has been a concern for us since the moment we started helping flow material into Ukraine. And that is why we don't talk about the routes. We don’t talk even about the locations in the theaters where the shipments are arriving. And it's why we're being very judicious about how material is getting into Ukraine. Because it's been a concern since the very, very beginning. 

Yes. Barb, did you have a question?

Q: Yes, thank you so much. I would like to go back to David's question. You seem to lay out, with your reasoning, very much a case that in fact security assistance is being done phased, is being done in slices, is being done peaceful, -- 
MR. KIRBY: I don't -- I --

Q: If I could just finish. You lay out -- thank you, I appreciate it. You lay out a very comprehensive case of U.S. strategy for doing it that way in order to make it -- in the view of the U.S. the most efficient for the Ukrainians to be able to take advantage of the sequential shipments. But President Zelensky, since the very beginning, has -- I just want to close the loop. 

President Zelensky, since the very beginning, has basically begged the world for as much in weaponry as fast, and I know you say you're doing it as fast as you can, but as fast as it can be gotten to Ukraine's fighters. So the Russian strategies, you knew -- everybody knew that they were going to go into Donbas, that was not a secret. I'm just wondering if you're looking at this and from this point forward perhaps looking at a different way of doing this other than in these slices or phases?

MR. KIRBY: Yes.

Q: Is there another way to do it?

MR. KIRBY: Let me push back on this verb of slicing it. I mean because I don't -- I don't think that's an accurate way of putting it. It's not about slicing. It is about packaging this and it's about doing it in a way that accurately and most effectively meets the needs of the Ukrainians in the moment and on the ground and in the fight that they're in. And that fight has changed. 

You said it was fairly obvious to everybody that they were going to focus on the Donbas. Well, Barb, you -- maybe you have better intelligence than we do. It wasn't obvious to everybody that that was what they were going to eventually going to. If you remember back on the 27th of February they were attacking Ukraine along three main lines of access. And one of them, and the one that everybody here was all worried about and around the world was worried about was Kyiv.

And there was all this discussion about how fast Kyiv was going to fall and when -- when were the Russians going to take it and how inevitable it was that Kyiv was going to fall and it didn't. And you know, one of the reasons it didn't was because we flowed in a lot of javelins. And we -- and other countries flowed in other capabilities to help them stop the Russian advance. 

And also, they failed because they didn't properly plan for logistics and sustainment; they didn't -- they made mistakes of their own. And so, the systems that we gave them, we and other nations gave them, helped them in the battle for Kyiv, and helped force the Russians to stop their advance. That was the focus for the moment, and it -- and it was rightly the focus for the moment. OK, now, it's the middle of April, the Russians have had to recalibrate. They've had to change their strategy. 

They've said it publicly themselves; you're seeing it on the ground; they're focusing on the Donbas. That is a different terrain. That is a different fight. It requires different capabilities for both sides. And so, in our iterative conversations with the Ukrainians, they have said, now that we're focusing on the Donbas, now that we know that's where the fight is coming, we really need -- fill in the blank, right. And artillery was one of those fills in the blanks. 

And so that's why we're focusing on this. And -- and -- and that's the right way to do this because the war does change over time. And it would be foolish for us to just throw the kitchen sink at them and then not have any flexibility as the war changes to make changes in the moment. Now, I understand President Zelensky wants as much as he can as fast as he can, too. I mean, his country is under siege; it's under attack; I perfectly understand that. 

But we've got to make sure that we're helping him in the most effective way. And we believe we are, and we'll see what the, you know, what future packages look like. But I guarantee you whatever they look like; they're -- they're going to be tailored based on the Ukrainian's needs in the moment and what their -- what they most require. 

Q: Do you feel that Ukraine can continue to wait while the Pentagon and -- and the suppliers that you work with around the world can contemplate these moments as they emerge? I'm just asking if there's a different way that you might be thinking about doing this...

MR. KIRBY: Well, we're always wanting to improve. I mean, I'm not -- nobody's going to stand up here and say we do everything perfectly every single time. And if there's a way to get more stuff there faster, we'll stay open to that. Absolutely. Nobody -- nobody's boasting here, nobody's patting ourselves on the back. 

But, let me just stress again the incredible speed and scale with which material is getting over there in recent memory, and recent history is truly unprecedented. And that is not an exaggeration. From the time, as I said, the President authorized this latest 800 million on the 13th of April, 48 hours later, on the 15th, the first plane was taking off with stuff in that package. And we're still completing prior packages of things that are still getting in there. So, every single day, at these transshipment sites in Europe, there's somewhere on the -- on the neighborhood of 8 to 10 flights coming in, and they're not all U.S. flights, and they're not all coming from America, but 8 to 10 flights. 

And every single day, Barb, that material is getting put on pallets and put -- and put on a ground delivery transportation means and getting into Ukraine via a various amount of routes. We are... 

Q: I don’t want to dominate this, but a week ago, you knew the Donbas was the target. You might not have known... 

MR. KIRBY: And a week ago, we were talking to the Ukrainians about what they would need as that fight was -- was -- was following up.

Q: Did they lay out – well -- you're gonna say that you won't answer this, but... 

MR. KIRBY: Go ahead, try me. 

Q: Yeah. I will. Have they laid out to you -- even if you don't want to say what it is, have they laid out to you the next phase of what they think they need? And are you hearing that they are satisfied with a phased approach; if not sliced, it is phased?

Q: I would tell you that we are having constant discussions with the Ukrainians. I don't want -- I mean, I don't want to leave you or anybody else with the impression that -- that -- that it is, as David described, sliced, like a piece of cake, like, OK, this is what you're gonna get. And then we don't talk to him again until the next piece of cake is needed. We're talking to them all the time. So, even after we arranged for this $800 million security package -- in fact, even as that discussion was going on, and those decisions were being made, and the -- and the sourcing was being done, we were having discussions with Ukrainians about future needs, and what that might look like. 

And those discussions have happened since the 13th of April. And we'll see where it goes. I'm not going to get ahead of decisions that haven't been announced yet. But it is a constant conversation that we're having with them. It's not -- it's not just slice one and be done and wait for the next one and -- and you know, we hang up the phone and don't talk to each other for a few days until there's another acute need, that's not how this is going. It's a constant conversation. 

Yeah? 

Q: Thank you.

MR. KIRBY: Go ahead. 

Q: Thank you so much. My question is also about the U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. So, as you mentioned there are these additional requests from Ukraine for additional weapons so how could the U.S. manage and balance between the security needs for Ukraine and the risk of escalation in light of Russia's threats to destroy western weapons?

MR. KIRBY: I don't know if I completely understand the question. But if you're asking me how we're... 

Q: ... between the risk of escalation and... 

MR. KIRBY: Risk of escalation. Yeah, look, I've talked about this before. I mean, our main focus is on helping Ukraine defend itself. And that means talking to them about what their needs are. And if it's a need, we can meet, or we know somebody else can meet, we'll do that. 

The Secretary is literally on the phone every day talking to allies and partners, including this day. And will include tomorrow, and Thursday, and Friday, to talk to allies and partners about these needs. And if it's a need we can't meet, or we can't meet soon enough, then maybe an ally or a partner can. And he's having those active discussions literally every single day. And look, of course, as the Secretary of Defense, he has to think about escalation management; that's his job. 

It would be irresponsible for him not to when you're talking about a guy like Mr. Putin with his reputation and the fact that he has nuclear capabilities and -- and also has a significant amount of combat capability still available to him in Ukraine. It would be foolhardy. And in fact, it would be, again, I say, irresponsible if we weren't also thinking about escalation management. So, that's a -- that's a balance that the Secretary has to strike every day. But the focus is and will remain on helping Ukraine defend itself.

Yeah? 

Q: John, on the Russian resupply efforts, there was a discussion yesterday that Western sanctions were hampering precision-guided munitions. President Zelensky mentioned that it was broader than maybe even helicopters and other technical equipment. What is your sense, beyond Western sanctions, of the Russian military's ability to resupply itself as it gears up for this next phase? 

MR. KIRBY: Beyond the sanctions? 

Q: Mm-hmm. 

MR. KIRBY: Well... 

Q: Including sanctions as well. I mean, you know, generally its ability to -- to resupply itself. 

MR. KIRBY: Yeah. Mr. Putin still has a lot of his inventory available to him. Some of it's been depleted, some of it's been destroyed, some of it's been captured. But he still has a lot of combat capability available to him. And I think it's important for us to just remember that. I couldn't tell you I don't know specifically what concerns they might have in Russia about supply chain issues and their own defense industrial base and how well it can replenish the inventory that he's gone through. 

But one would have to assume that -- that they're thinking about that because even though they have a lot left to them, they've gone through a lot. And it's our -- it's our belief that -- that some of the sanctions levied against Russia will have a downstream effect on their ability to procure certain items and components to help them with their -- with their -- with their inventory and their stocks; precision-guided munitions is a good example of that. But I -- I don't want to overstate that right now. Mr. Putin still has quite a bit of combat capability and inventory available to him.

Q: And a couple of months ago, ahead of the initial invasion, there was an awful lot of talk about the consequences of the weather and freezing. And as this phase in the Donbas begins to ramp up, what's your sense of what Russia's capability could be given that, you know, we're well past the ground freezing there, and the inability even with the ground frozen for them to maneuver outside of roadways? 

MR. KIRBY: Yeah, I think it's -- the weather's always a factor in war. And the spring weather it -- it, as we know, it's been a factor for, frankly, for both sides. Even if just -- even -- even just this week. The -- the ground as it makes it harder for them to operate off of paved roads and highways. It doesn't make it impossible because they do have track vehicles, but -- but it does make it more -- more difficult. 

Again, I think, taking 10 steps back and just remembering. I know I say this all the time, but I think it's important to keep foot stomping it. This is an area of Ukraine that they have literally been fighting over now for eight years. Both sides know the terrain; they know where the roads are, they know where they're not. They -- they know the population centers. 

And -- and -- and both sides are -- are doing what they can to achieve their own goals in the Donbas. But this is not a part of Ukraine that's alien to them the way the north part of Ukraine and around Chernihiv and Kyiv was in terms of operational maneuver. This is a part of Ukraine that they -- that they understand well. 

Q: (OFF-MIKE)? 

MR. KIRBY: A non-Ukraine? 

Q: (OFF-MIKE). 

MR. KIRBY: Let me just get through. I got a couple more on the phone, and then I'll come back to you. 

Q: Thank you. 

MR. KIRBY: Kellie from NewsNation? 

Q: Hey, John, thanks for taking my question. Some of my other ones were asked already, so I will -- I have one on a separate topic that I wanted to ask you about just in terms of any more specifics on the deaths of the sailors assigned to the USS George Washington, any connection on those deaths?

MR. KIRBY: I would refer you to the Navy, Kellie. My understanding from speaking to Navy officials this morning is that -- I mean, obviously, they're still investigating these deaths. I don't believe that they are aware of any indications that they are -- are related. But that -- that's what they believe right now. And I want to, you know, I think we need to give them time to properly investigate these deaths. 

And I would just add that all of us here at the Department of Defense, our thoughts and prayers go out to the families for those -- those sailors who -- who are now no longer in the ranks. I mean, that's -- these are now going to be families getting the worst possible news and dealing with unspeakable grief. And I just think it's important that they know that the Department of Defense, the Secretary, we're going to -- we'll give them all the support that they -- that they deserve.

Heather from USNI? 

Q: Thank you so much. I was wondering if there's any update on the Moskva in terms of the number of crew that might have survived or a number of those who might have perished in the sinking?

MR. KIRBY: I don't. And I -- and I don't think, Heather, that we'll -- we'll ever know perfectly how many sailors perished aboard the ship and how many survived. I mean, just in general, we -- we do not believe that -- that every member of the crew survived. But how they perished, how many perished, we just don't know. 

Tom?

Q: Thanks, John. After focusing on the South China Sea, China now is increasing its activity in the East China Sea. And the Japanese have, for the last three, four days, have expressed great concern about the Yonaguni Islands, which are very close to Taiwan, where the U.S. used to have a military presence. Is it possible -- would -- would that be possible for the U.S. to reconsider? I know, it's speculation, but I mean, they were there once before, but given the state of the Japanese Constitution, which limits their military ability to consider reinforcing the Japanese avast?

MR. KIRBY: I don't have any decisions like that to speak to Tom. I mean, obviously, Japan is a treaty ally; we take our responsibilities for their self-defense very, very seriously. But I'm not aware of any discussions or conversations here at the Department of changing the -- the posture with respect to the East China Sea. 

Q: Thank you. 

MR. KIRBY: Yep. 

OK, I got to go. I'll take one more. Go ahead.

Q: Oh, just jumping on Tom's bandwagon here. There -- there have been discussions in Europe ongoing now about concerns of China's increasing influence. Where on the spectrum of intensity and time sensitivity do you see that kind of worry?

MR. KIRBY: I think we've long been concerned about China's growing influence around the world to include Europe. And I would, you know, note that it's not just the United States, but -- but our NATO allies are likewise concerned. At the defense ministerial earlier this year, not the last one, but the -- back in the -- back in the fall, for the -- for the first time, NATO Defense Ministers put concerns about China in the communique at the end of the defense ministerial. So, it's a concern that many nations have about growing Chinese influence that -- that is inimical to many of their own national security goals and objectives. And it's not just there; it's in Africa, it's in South America. I mean, the -- the Chinese continue to try to bully and intimidate their way into pursuing their own selfish national security interests at the expense of populations all around the world. 

Q: And do you see them using the focus now on Ukraine justly so? Do you see this as they're taking advantage of an opportunity here to sort of intensify their activities or? 

MR. KIRBY: I don't -- I don't know that they're -- necessarily you can pin this kind of behavior just on -- on what's going on in Ukraine or that they somehow view that the rest of the world is distracted by Ukraine. I mean, this has been a consistent play by the Chinese for the last several years. 

OK, thanks, everybody.

2022-04-20,"Russia announced on Wednesday it had successfully launched a new missile that it said could deploy nuclear warheads at hypersonic speeds anywhere in the world and outwit defenses, a move that President Vladimir V. Putin said was aimed at showing Russia’s adversaries that they needed to “think twice” before threatening his country.

But even if the test was successful, the new missile does not appear ready for use. The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday’s test launch of the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile was its first and that it would enter Russia’s arsenal only “after the completion of the testing program.” There was no immediate comment from American officials about the launch.

Mr. Putin first announced Russia had developed the Sarmat in 2018, but his decision to test it on Wednesday appeared intended to send a blunt message in the middle of the war in Ukraine. Analysts have speculated that Mr. Putin could escalate the threat of using nuclear weapons to try to deter Western countries from supporting Ukraine and to force Ukraine to surrender.

“This truly unique weapon will force all who are trying to threaten our country in the heat of frenzied, aggressive rhetoric to think twice,” Mr. Putin said in brief televised remarks on Wednesday.

The Defense Ministry released footage showing a white missile emerging from an underground silo in a snowy launch site in a ball of fire and then speeding into the sky. The launch took place at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in northwest Russia, the ministry said, and hit a target on the Kamchatka Peninsula 3,500 miles to the east.

Mr. Putin was shown overseeing the launch by videoconference at the Kremlin and receiving a report from Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu. Mr. Putin said in his brief remarks that the Sarmat consisted only of Russian-made components, an apparent attempt to show that Russia’s defense industry was undaunted by Western economic sanctions.

","On April 20, Putin announced the successful test of a new nuclear-capable Sarmat intercontinental
ballistic missile. This, he said, was “a great and landmark event in the development of advanced
weapon systems in the Russian army.” There was “no” comparable system “in the world” and there
would not be any “for a long time to come,” Putin claimed. “This truly unique weapon will bolster the
combat capabilities of our Armed Forces, … reliably safeguard Russia’s security from external threats
and … make those who in the frenzy of rabid and aggressive rhetoric are trying to threaten our country think twice,” he added.217 Per the Russian Defense Ministry, however, the missile was still in a

2022-04-25,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin insisted Monday that Russia was failing in its Ukraine incursion, with Austin explicitly saying that the US wants to see Russia’s military capabilities weakened.

The two top US officials, speaking at a news conference at an undisclosed location in Poland near the Ukrainian border, made the comments following a trip to Kyiv, where they met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to pledge US support in the war and announce that US diplomats would be returning to Ukraine.

“We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin said at the news conference. “So it has already lost a lot of military capability. And a lot of its troops, quite frankly. And we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability.”

Blinken told reporters that Russian attempts to “subjugate Ukraine and take its independence” has “failed.”

“Russia has sought as its principal aim to totally subjugate Ukraine, to take away its sovereignty, to take away its independence – that has failed. It has sought to assert the power of its military and its economy. We, of course, are seeing just the opposite, a military that is dramatically underperforming and an economy … as a result of sanctions that is in shambles,” Blinken said.

“We don’t know how the rest of this war will unfold, but we do know that a sovereign independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin is on the scene,” he said.

The remarks are the latest in a series of public comments by US leaders challenging Putin’s longevity as Russia’s President and as the war in Ukraine has shifted to a new phrase in the east. US President Joe Biden and the White House have said the US is not officially calling for regime change and officials have also predicted a potentially drawn-out conflict.

Austin’s comments also seem to represent a further extension of US goals, building on past comments from Blinken and other officials about Moscow’s status at the end of the war.

Blinken last week said in a statement that the US’ “continued efforts to ratchet up pressure on Putin’s crumbling economy together will help weaken the Russian Government’s position and further isolate them from the world until Russia ends its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.”

The White House said Monday that Austin was talking about the US “objective to prevent” the Russian military from taking over Ukraine, and described it as consistent with the administration’s long-held goal.

Asked about the defense secretary’s comments, a National Security Council spokesperson said the US wants Ukraine to win and “that’s why we’re doing everything we can to help Ukraine defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to strengthen the Ukrainians’ hands on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.”

A senior State Department official told the traveling press Monday that such negotiations are “evolving,” noting that “Russia’s hand has been weakened as a result of these first two months, Ukraine’s hand has been strengthened, that effects the positions that there would be in any negotiation,” but “part of the problem is as best we can tell there is no effective negotiation going on right now.”
","Austin went further, declaring that the United States now wanted “to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” a statement some observers interpreted as an expansion of NATO’s goals."," Austin: United States wants “to see Russia weakened to the degree

2022-04-25,"Question: Thank you for finding the time in your busy schedule to talk to us.

Sergey Lavrov: Thank you for inviting me. This is a big game, so I have to play it.

Question: Indeed, the stakes are high. I am confident that much of what is being said in Washington is at odds with how you view the actual developments. However, I think you will probably agree with what President Joe Biden said about the importance of avoiding World War III. We need to keep in mind that this threat does exist.

Graham Allison, whom you know well – he is a prominent political scientist at Harvard and former Assistant Secretary of Defence – said that today’s situation is as explosive as it was during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. In fact, it could be even more dangerous, since there is less clarity about the rules of the game and more mutual distrust. What do you think about the extent of the crisis we are all facing today? How real is it? What can and will Russia do about it?

Sergey Lavrov: Russia is already doing a lot. For many years, as far back as during the Donald Trump presidency, we called for Moscow and Washington to reaffirm at the highest level the 1987 statement by Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan, who said that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.

We tried to convince Donald Trump’s team to reaffirm this statement, considering its importance for our nations and for the entire world. Unfortunately, we failed to persuade our colleagues that this step was needed. However, we reached common ground with the Joe Biden administration quite quickly, and our presidents issued the statement in June 2021 during their Geneva summit.

In January 2022, we fulfilled another initiative to this effect. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council adopted a statement along the same lines, which was supposed to coincide with the opening of the Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. All five leaders put their signatures under the statement that a nuclear war must never happen. This is our position of principle, and we are committed to it. The risks are quite high today. I would not like to see them blown out of proportion, but many would love to do it. This threat is serious and real. It must not be underestimated.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis, there were not many written rules, but the rules of conduct were quite clear. Moscow understood how Washington was acting, while Washington understood Moscow’s behaviour.

Today, few rules remain. We have the New START – the Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. Joe Biden made a good and wise step by supporting Russia’s proposal to extend the treaty for five years without any conditions as his first foreign policy decision. The Trump administration refused to proceed with this formula.

At the same time, the other arms control and non-proliferation instruments have been destroyed. The ABM Treaty limiting missile defence systems and the INF Treaty – the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, no longer exist. The US has turned down our proposal to introduce a mutual moratorium, even though we proposed agreeing on verification mechanisms as part of this proposal. The main objection the West has is that they do not “trust” us that the Iskander systems in Kaliningrad do not violate the terms of the INF Treaty. Guided by the principle of reciprocity, we offered them to visit Kaliningrad, while we would visit US missile defence bases in Poland and Romania. This was an honest proposal, but they have been refusing it ever since. The Open Skies Treaty has also run its course. It does not exist anymore.

The New START is the only remaining arms control treaty. We were ready to discuss what will happen in five years (now we have only four years left), and we started this conversation with the Americans, since we all proceed from the premise that this was the last extension. We had two useful rounds of talks in July and September 2021. After that, we held working contacts. They demonstrated that we have serious differences, which were clear to us and to the Americans. We agreed on setting up two working groups and tasked them with defining the subject matter of the treaty and specific threats to be reviewed during future talks.

The United States cancelled almost all contacts due to the fact that we were forced to stand up for the Russians in Ukraine. Those people lived under constant shelling for eight years without any response from the West. On the contrary, all the West did was encourage Russophobic and neo-Nazi actions by the Kiev regime. Ukraine passed laws banning the Russian language from all areas of life: education, the media, and everyday communication, while encouraging neo-Nazi theories and practices.

To follow up on rules, it’s a buzzword the United States and its allies use when they tell everyone to behave. They now insist on compliance with the rules-based order rather than international law. No description of these rules is available.

They say the rules are not many. For us, they don't exist at all. There is international law. We respect it and the UN Charter. The sovereign equality of states is its key provision and the core principle. The US is flagrantly violating its obligations under the UN Charter when it promotes its rules and wants the whole world to blindly follow in its step and do as its already compliant allies (primarily in Europe and some Asian countries) are doing. It does not fulfil the obligation to respect the sovereign equality of states. In fact, it is blatantly trampling upon this equality and is forcing everyone to follow its rules.

US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen gave a particularly fitting definition of these rules. She was speaking about something else, but that does not affect the meaning of what she said. She was talking about the idea of reforming the Bretton Woods institutions. Not being bound by any foreign policy conventionalities, she made clear that this reform should by no means lead to the formation of a bipolar world, and the United States should actively work with China in order for Beijing to absorb this message. She couldn’t have been clearer about it. They need a unipolar world as they see it now, and every reform should be carried out exclusively within the unipolar world philosophy.

Even when President Trump was in office, the United States spoke in favour of reforming the WTO. As it turned out, China has beat them and continues to beat them on the platforms created by the Americans as part of globalisation and the WTO rules that it created. It is not accidental that Washington blocked the WTO dispute resolution body, to which China submitted scores of complaints. The Americans are taking advantage of procedural tricks to block appointments to fill vacancies in that body so it does not have a quorum and remains non-operational.

When it came to the WTO reform, Washington stated that it should be carried out by the United States and Europe, whereas China should be “kept out” of it. Acting unprofessionally and giving out its plans is a hallmark of our Western colleagues, who feel free to do anything they want. They openly state that they will be in charge and that NATO is entitled to do as it pleases. They can say that NATO is a defensive alliance, so there’s “no need to be afraid” and “this organisation does not threaten anyone's security.” Next thing you know Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg is saying that NATO bears global responsibility for security, including in the Indo-Pacific region.

By the same token, once the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union were gone, they moved the “line of defence” (since they are a defensive alliance) eastward, closer to our borders on five occasions and told us not “to fret,” since it is inconsequential for our security. Rather impolitely, they made it clear that we are not the ones to decide on our security needs.

Now, they are going to move the “defence line” of their “defensive” alliance to the South China Sea, which goes hand-in-hand with creating AUKUS and QUAD, and dragging Japan, Korea and half of the ASEAN countries into AUKUS. They are trying to tear down the architecture that has been taking shape over the span of many decades and relied on consensus and the participation of all major players, including the United States, Russia, India, Japan, China and Australia. This is now also subject to change in line with unipolarity, which they are trying to save by hook or by crook.

Everyone’s mantra is that a third world war must be staved off at all costs. President Zelensky of Ukraine and his team’s unending provocations should beconsidered in this context. They almost go as far as requesting NATO to send its troops in to protect the Ukrainian government. However, everyone keeps saying that they will provide Kiev with weapons, which adds fuel to the fire. They want to use these arms deliveries to make the Ukrainians fight against Russia to the last soldier in order to make this conflict last longer, so that Russia, as they hope, suffers more from it.

As they keep supplying weapons and promoting their efforts in this area, all leaders (except Poland) state that sending NATO troops in is out of the question. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki came up with the idea of a kind of “peacekeeping operation” in Ukraine, clearly interested in sending Polish troops to Ukraine under peacekeeping flags. Next, we can imagine how the historical memory of the Poles, who will find themselves in their former territory – western Ukraine – will work.

How are we supposed to behave? Can this be compared to the Cuban  Missile Crisis? In those years, there was a channel of communication that both leaders trusted. Now there is no such channel. Nobody is trying to create it. A few timid attempts made at an early stage have not produced any notable result. We have been desperate to reach NATO all these years. Contrary to their promises, the alliance continued to expand; contrary to our warnings, they have been pumping weapons into Ukraine and in every possible way encouraging its Russophobic tendency (the regime established under Petro Poroshenko and strengthened under Vladimir Zelensky). We repeatedly warned them against drawing Ukraine into NATO. As a last resort or a goodwill gesture, we proposed that the Americans and NATO members sign appropriate security agreements that would ensure the security of all states in the Euro-Atlantic area, including Ukraine. Everyone understood that Ukraine was an apple of discord, which revealed a far bigger problem and became a trigger in these processes. We proposed signing an agreement with the United States and NATO on providing guarantees for all countries jointly, collectively, without expanding any military-political blocs.

They listened politely. And then they said that they could not restrict NATO’s expansion because it would be contrary to their “open-door policy.” We reviewed the Charter of the North Atlantic Alliance and found that Article 10 did not mention any “open doors.” It says NATO can invite new members by consensus if they meet the criteria (apparently, democratic control) and, most importantly, if the new members contribute to the security of NATO member countries. No “open doors” or anything. They took in Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Albania. How can those countries contribute to NATO security if it is a “defensive” alliance? This shows that NATO’s expansion has nothing to do with its statutory goals. This is an expansion of territories under American command, and an attempt at strengthening and perpetuating that same old unipolar world. We’ve had talks between the delegations from Russia and the United States. I met with Antony Blinken. Our team went to the North Atlantic Alliance to present the proposed agreement in the Russia-NATO context. The talks showed there was no inclination among any members of the other party to consider our legitimate security interests.

We told them, friends, you’re on our borders. Russian President Vladimir Putin repeatedly and publicly pointed out that they had reached our doorstep despite all our requests, statements, and warnings. They just kept advancing and were not going to change anything. They say their actions are not aimed against us, and they are not threatening our security. What are we supposed to make of this? Now they are cosying up to India, trying to involve that country in their formats in every possible way. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson travelled to India, and before that, American representatives did, too. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman publicly (all this is done blatantly) stated: the United States must “help” India understand what it needs to ensure its security. It is not some tiny island country they are referring to, but a great civilisation. They are saying similar things about China, too, they say they will “explain” what punishment will follow if Beijing supports Russia.

At the same time, when the United States suddenly decides something more than 10,000 kilometres away is threatening their interests – the former Yugoslavia, or Iraq, or somewhere else in the Middle East – they send troops, bomb civilian targets without hesitation, without any legal scruples or attempts to read up international law or the UN Charter. This is what happened in Belgrade: bridges, passenger trains, the television centre… Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was not a television centre, but an outlet of aggressive Serbian propaganda. In much the same way, President of France Emmanuel Macron has denied RT television channel and Sputnik accreditation for the Elysee Palace, calling them “propaganda tools” rather than media outlets.

These mannerisms, habits and attitudes are deep-rooted. They razed Iraqi Mosul and Syrian Raqqa to the ground. Dead bodies lay there for weeks. That, all the way across the ocean – a threat to the security of the United States of America. In Kosovo, they established the largest military base in the Balkans (maybe not only in the Balkans). No one is going to withdraw it. The “reason” for doing that was the “instability” that Slobodan Milosevic was allegedly generating in that region, oppressing the Kosovo Albanians. Let me emphasise once again: they seem to believe they’re entitled to uphold their own security wherever they please, while we are denied the right to defend our own borders and territories where Russians live, who have been oppressed there for many years, subjected to bombing, abuse, infringements on their rights to their language, culture, and traditions.

This is the problem – they have an incorrigible  confidence in their own rightness and exceptionality. They have this term, “exceptional nation,” which both Democrats and Republicans use the same way. This sense of superiority brings back some memories, especially now that Russophobia and real racism with regard to things Russian is being cultivated at the highest level. Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau recently announced that Vladimir Putin and all those who support him must be punished, adding that not only Russia, but all Russians will pay for this.

Question: I believe that Washington would not refute what you have said here. But they would formulate it differently. They would ask: Mr Minister, do you insist that authoritarian states should have the same rights as democratic countries?

Sergey Lavrov: Yes, I do.

Question: Since you do, and they see this as unacceptable, this is one of the main conceptual differences between Moscow and Washington. They say that NATO is a defensive alliance and Russia has nothing to fear from it. But they mean – after all, you are not silly or naïve – that this is only true if you “behave.”

Sergey Lavrov: I am fully aware of this.

Question: If the “alliance of democracies” called NATO believes that a country “misbehaves,” that country is faced with unpleasant consequences, depending on what it has done. I believe that NATO does not even make a secret of this.

What should be done about the crisis around Ukraine in the context of the challenges you have mentioned and the huge gap in our approaches to international relations and modern civilisation in general? Are any talks on a peaceful settlement in Ukraine possible, given the acute conflict and the vastly divergent approaches of Russia and US-led NATO and the mistrust between them?

Sergey Lavrov: The United States, just like all other countries that pride themselves on being flawless democracies, have signed and ratified the UN Charter, with its underlying principle of the sovereign equality of states. It does not say that democracies should have more rights than autocracies, dictatorships or monarchies. It does not mention any differences between the rights of the UN member states.

Yes, the UN Security Council is a different matter. All of us know why Franklin Delano Roosevelt insisted on the establishment of the Security Council of five permanent member states and the right of veto: he did not want the UN to follow in the footsteps of the League of Nations. If not for this institution established at Roosevelt’s initiative, the UN could have long fallen into oblivion, just as the League of Nations did. There is nothing good in a situation where great powers cannot use their prerogatives and cannot come to an agreement with each other. The right of veto forces them to hammer out agreements, at least, this is how it was for years.

Today the Americans and other Western countries are trying to erode the value of the right of veto. They want to shift this prerogative of the Security Council to the UN General Assembly, where they hope to force a majority vote by arm-twisting, blackmail and even threats regarding the delegations’ bank accounts and schools for their children. It is a dangerous trend. The Security Council with five permanent members and the right of veto is the last remaining pocket of international law. They are trying to replace everything else.

It was for a reason that US President Joe Biden held a “summit for democracy” in late 2021. There are plans to hold a second summit this year and to create an organisation that will operate as anti-UN and will replace the UN.

It is not a new trend. For some years now, the West, primarily France and Germany, has been creating all manner of platforms, calls and partnerships, mostly in Europe, on issues that are on the UN agenda, such as a partnership on international humanitarian law. It has a limited membership and is not open to everyone. When we ask why they do not want to discuss these issues at the universal scale, for example, at the offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees or the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, they reply that there are too many “retrogrades” there. They say that there are autocracies and insufficiently democratic countries among UN members, and that they need to develop progressive ideas. Germany and France have created the Alliance of Democracies and the Alliance for Multilateralism.

When asked why they have forgotten about the UN, the supreme example of multilateralism where all countries in the world are represented (with the exception of a few states that have not been recognised yet), they reply that members of such organisations have to be convinced to accept multilateralism and that they need a “vanguard of multilateralism.” They say that they will use the EU’s approach to “multilateral cooperation” to form a group of like-minded nations. This is a superiority complex and an unwillingness to discuss any issues in formats where they can be contradicted and opposed. They don’t want it, because this will take time which they need to implement their neoliberal reforms as soon as possible. Also, I believe that they think they may lose in a fair debate when both sides present their arguments.

Just take a look at the list of countries invited to the summit for democracy. The United States never regarded some of them as democracies. They were criticised for actions which Washington regards as undemocratic, but they have been included in the “alliance of democratic countries” because the United States wants to make use of their strategic position in its own interests. Washington wants to put them under a “democratic umbrella” as a form of flattery, so as to be able to use them to its advantage.

We have been using such terms as “democracy,” “autocracy” and “authoritarian states.” American political analysts have recently started referring to India not as a major democratic country but as an “electoral autocracy.” I have mentioned this fact to my Indian friends. They smiled in acknowledgment. There are many methods of holding countries in suspense.

With regard to the talks about Ukraine, we know for sure that the United States and the UK (which is going out of its way with its indefatigable efforts to compensate for its loner status after leaving the EU) are advising President Zelensky not to speed up the talks, but to toughen his position each time instead. We saw this after the meeting in Istanbul, where, as President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said in his interviews and conversations with his colleagues, we received, for the first time, their written proposals which were signed by the leaders of their delegation. We were ready to use them as a basis for further talks. Of course, they had to be revised in order to become a consensus document, but we received them positively. So far, the only written proposals we have were submitted in Istanbul. It was not a draft treaty, but rather a set of talking points. We quickly drafted a treaty based on these points and handed it over to our Ukrainian colleagues. Then, they came up with their own ideas, which were drastically different from what was done in Istanbul, which was a huge Lenin-style step back. This step back (or rather two) was taken on the advice of our US or British colleagues. The Poles or the Baltic states may have played their part as well.

Question: So Ukraine has toughened its position?

Sergey Lavrov: They have gone back on the positions that the Russian side was willing to accept as a basis. We have drafted a document which translated their proposals into treaty language. Kiev representatives told us it was not like that and they wouldn’t write it down and suggested postponing it. Nevertheless, after that we continued to participate in online discussions and provided our arguments to back up our position. A week ago, after another videoconference, we gave them a revised version of the treaty, which included their subsequent comments, as it is usually done. We’ve been waiting for their response for a week now.

When asked at a news conference about his take on our proposals, President Zelensky said he received nothing and saw nothing. We asked the Ukrainian negotiators whether they reported it to the President. They said President Zelensky was pressed for time. This goes to show what the President of Ukraine thinks of the talks as he solemnly declares that he “prefers peace.”

Question: As I was getting ready for this interview with you, I contacted the Washington administration. They deny that they are encouraging Kiev to drag out the talks. Instead, they are saying that they see their mission in supporting President Zelensky, and Kiev’s position in the talks with Russia is the position of the President of Ukraine, not the United States. The thing that interests me now more than anything else is the growing US military assistance to Zelensky’s government. I think that Washington is afraid of the President of Ukraine (this is my personal assessment). He managed to position himself in a unique manner as the leader of a country that is the “victim of aggression” by a stronger state and, at the same time, as someone who is personally desirous of supporting democracy throughout the world. Washington is saying that helping President Zelensky with as many weapons as possible is not so much a policy seeking to prolong the war, but compensation for the fact that the United States is unwilling to get involved in the hostilities.

Sergey Lavrov: I disagree. They are already putting it differently, “Vladimir Zelensky must defeat Vladimir Putin.” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that Russia must be defeated. EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said that victory must be achieved on the battlefield. They are not embarrassed by not sending their troops. It’s not that they want to support the newly minted “hero.” Zelensky is portrayed as a “beacon of democracy,” but, in fact, he is promoting a ban on everything Russian and encouraging foundations for strengthening neo-Nazism and Nazi theory and practice in his country at the legislative level.

But it's not about that. They want to do their best to make sure that Zelensky inflicts irreparable damage on Russia and defeats it “on the battlefield” (although sensible people understand the situation). Then the Russians will have to ask for mercy and agree to much less favourable terms than they planned on initially. There are speculations of that kind out there.

Question: The words about “mercy” are coming from “commentators” in Congress rather than the White House.

Sergey Lavrov: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks almost the same language.

Question: Boris Johnson is a special case.

Sergey Lavrov: I agree, but Vladimir Zelensky is a special case, too. They are quite similar in terms of their ability to cater to the public and to imitate. For example, they only imitate actual negotiations. Zelensky had one week to study Russia’s proposals. Today I read remarks by Verkhovna Rada Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk who noted that, based on this crisis, Ukraine would not remove a constitutional provision regarding its intention to join NATO. How can you explain this? We are discussing Kiev’s neutral and non-aligned status with security guarantees covering a specific territory in all of our talks. Zelensky is saying openly that they are ready for a neutral and non-nuclear status. At the same time, the Verkhovna Rada Speaker is noting that nothing will be deleted from the constitution and that Ukraine will continue to pursue NATO membership just like before.

What is seen in the West as a talented presentation of the Ukrainian president’s interests and approaches is peculiar. He is a good actor, but funny things happen to him sometimes, and they reveal what state he’s in. We will see a thousand discrepancies if we take a closer look and delve into the gist of his remarks. He contradicts himself every other day with certain statements, then renounces them and goes back to his earlier position. This is true.

You have the impression that the administration in Washington has coined the image of a person who has virtually subordinated the entire Western democratic world and who has come to embody and symbolise democracy. Again, where were our Western colleagues when this democracy banned all things Russian, including the Russian language, education and media outlets, and when it destroyed Russian Orthodox churches? In their time, Bandera and Shukhevich, when commanding the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, serving Hitler (the Galichina Division of the Waffen SS), destroyed Polish Catholic churches, and they said they would destroy everything Polish and kill all Poles. Even the Poles are now trying to keep silent about this. School textbooks no longer mention the Volyn massacre. But at that time, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, commanded by Shukhevich and Bandera, declared that eliminating the Poles was its goal. This is very close to current statements by Ukrainian neo-Nazis on eliminating Russians.

Question: Putting Washington’s intentions aside, I suggest that we discuss what the US administration is doing. How do we characterise this? I am referring to the unprecedented and surprising, at least for me, scale of US military assistance to Vladimir Zelensky’s government. There was $800 million two weeks ago, and another $800 million a week ago. On their recent visit to Kiev, the US secretaries of state and defence pledged another $700 million.

Sergey Lavrov: They are giving money not only to Ukraine, but also to all Eastern European countries. Kiev received roughly half of these giveaways.

Question: Fair enough. My question is: what will the consequences be? I am not so much asking you about your assessment, even though it is very important, but what Russia will do about this? Or maybe Moscow believes that no matter how hard they try out there in Washington, this will not change the balance of power in any meaningful way?

Sergey Lavrov: I read several anonymous statements by serving US military personnel on what happens with these weapons when they cross the Ukrainian border and where they end up. They said they do not have any information on where all these weapons go.

Apart from tanks and armoured vehicles, Ukraine also receives thousands of portable air-defence systems, the weapons terrorist use. It is not a coincidence that we had an agreement with the United States for many years to inform each other about any deliveries of MANPADS abroad. This way, they knew that we did not allow these formidable weapons to fall into the wrong hands, while we also knew that they would not make any mistakes or ill-advised moves. The Javelin is also a portable missile system. It may have been invented as an anti-tank missile system, but it can also be used to carry out terrorist attacks. Where do all these weapons go? Let me emphasise that we are talking about thousands and thousands of units here.

In Ukraine, Azov and Aidar neo-Nazi battalions and other units that do not report to the commander-in-chief, and are proud of it, have a special, autonomous, untouchable status within the armed forces. If experience is any guide, like any country with a weak government, these weapons will spread around, including to the countries supplying them to Ukraine. In these countries, there are also groups, especially in the context of migration processes, who would love to lay their hands on these weapons. The American military ignores where these weapons go. Maybe they do know some things, but there are definitely things they ignore. What will the Russian Federation do? When Turkey sold the Bayraktar drones to Ukraine, which happened a long time ago, they were used for reconnaissance purposes in Donbass for many years to help the Ukrainian Armed Forces shell this region in what amounted to a flagrant violation of the Minsk agreements.

Vladimir Zelensky has buried these agreements publicly. He refused to honour them, just like the decision taken at the December 2019 Normandy summit in Paris, even though there was nothing about Lugansk, Donetsk or Russia there. All he had to do was pass a law granting Donbass special status. Nothing more. He did not have to do anything else. But he was the one who had to do it! Nobody else could have done this in his place. He subscribed to this. But then, for three years he went around lamenting that Russia failed to fulfil the Minsk agreements. This is ridiculous. He has been simulating talks with the Russian Federation the same way he imitates democracy, while in fact cancelling democracy, culture and imposing the dictate of radicals.

These weapons will be a legitimate target for the Russian Armed Forces during the special operation. They have already targeted warehouses, including in western Ukraine. How can it be otherwise? NATO has de facto entered into a proxy war with Russia by arming its proxy. War is war, as the saying goes.

As for arms supplies, this is another example of American bad faith in terms of international law and the fact that they are guided by the principle “do as you please.” The United States had about two dozen Soviet and Russian Mi-17 helicopters. In better times, we had a comprehensive project within the Russia-NATO Council to work together to promote a settlement in Afghanistan. It was called the Helicopter Package. We supplied helicopters, and they paid for them. We provided maintenance for these helicopters, and they were delivered to Afghan security forces. Today, Washington said aloud that it was going to hand over these helicopters to Vladimir Zelensky. We drew their attention to the fact that they had acquired the helicopters under a contract with Rosoboronexport, which states that these helicopters can only be used by Afghan security forces, while prohibiting any transfer to third countries without Russia’s consent. The obligation not to transfer the helicopters to third parties is set forth in end-use certificates, first signed before 2013 under the Helicopter Package when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, and then by John Kerry. Therefore, sending these helicopters to Ukraine amounts to an outright violation in a very important sphere of international relations.

Question: Do I understand correctly that with the current level of Russian-American relations and the confrontation in Ukraine, the chances of a diplomatic settlement remain slim until there is greater clarity about the military dynamics in Ukraine? At this stage, it is about the armed forces and the dynamics of military confrontation during the special operation, which can drive progress in diplomacy and open up new opportunities or, on the contrary, close them.

Sergey Lavrov: This is not entirely up to us; much depends on those who lead Ukraine and exercise external control over the Zelensky administration. I mentioned Istanbul. At that face-to-face meeting, the Russian side for the first time received the Ukrainians’ proposals in writing. We were ready to accept that as a basic draft; we gave our clarifications, but conceptually agreed with what was proposed there – a neutral status, security guarantees, their volume and the procedure for providing them. In a rough approximation, anyway. But they deviated from that concept.

I won't give away any big secrets, but here's one example. The Istanbul document said there would be no foreign military bases in Ukraine, and no exercises would be held there involving foreign forces unless there is consent from all the guarantor countries of this treaty, including Russia. This is what was written, verbatim. But the version they served us with after our positive reaction said, no exercises except with the agreement of the majority of the guarantor countries. See the difference? It’s obvious. And they did the same with a number of other proposals they had made in Istanbul. Let me emphasise once again that those proposals were generally received positively.

As for where and when we can expect to complete the negotiation of the agreement, we must keep in mind that the Istanbul meeting took place against a certain backdrop on the ground. The situation is different now. We have a feeling that the West wants Ukraine to continue fighting. They seem to believe this would wear out, wear down the Russian army and the Russian defence industry. But this is an illusion.

Are you the last Sovietologist left?

Question: Not quite. There are several more, even within the administration. But the political dynamics in Washington are not on their side.

Sergey Lavrov: The old guard, yes. As my American friends told me, back in the 1990s, when the Soviet Union collapsed, Soviet studies ceased to interest people. They did not think it would be a very promising field of study. Just like Middle Eastern Studies at some stage.

Now, back to the relationship between the situation on the ground and a hypothetical or, say, eventual peace settlement. There is a connection indeed. As we underscored from day one, as Vladimir Putin said in his statement announcing the special operation, we primarily wanted the Ukrainian people to be able to decide what to do with their country or their lives.

Question: If I understand you correctly, Russia will continue its policy and is so far not ready to depart from the demands it put forward at the start of the special operation. Will Moscow do what it deems necessary in terms of military operations? 

Sergey Lavrov: There is no doubt about it. What we deem necessary has been announced by President Vladimir Putin. I am referring to the need to destroy Ukraine’s military infrastructure in the context of demilitarising it. To quote President Putin, Ukraine has been turned into an “anti-Russia” and a direct threat to this country. But the Russian military must meet very strict requirements to minimise damage to the civilian population.

We will expose the fake news that was proliferating after Bucha. They are attempting to represent the situation at Azovstal as created by Russia. Allegedly, Moscow is preventing civilians from leaving the plant. They are lying through their teeth, including the lie that we have not opened humanitarian corridors, even though this is announced for all to hear every day, with buses and ambulances being sent [to the corridors]. Ukraine is using civilians as human shields both in Mariupol and in other areas, where hostilities and the Russian operation are in progress. Its other ruse is to fail to notify people or prevent them from leaving, detaining them by force. Those who have managed to escape on their own describe how they are treated by the soldiers from the Azov battalion and other “territorial organisations.

Like any situation involving the use of armed force, everything will end in a treaty. But the parameters will be determined by the stage the military operations are at when this treaty becomes a reality.

Question: This is a very interesting and important conversation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation. You are a master of diplomacy. It seems to me that you have displayed an iron will to do what Russia deems necessary, but you have never closed the door to diplomatic negotiations.  You even said that Ukraine’s initial position was interesting and could be used for an agreement. This is a rather complex position. Did I express this incorrectly?

Sergey Lavrov: No, this is correct. But, you know, goodwill is not unlimited. If it is not reciprocated it cannot promote the negotiating process. Many people in Russia are convinced (I have talked about this) that Ukraine’s position is actually determined by Washington, London and other Western capitals. Russian political scientists say, “Why do we talk to Zelensky? We should just talk with the Americans, come to terms with them and reach an agreement.” But we continue to negotiate with Mr Zelensky’s team.

As far as the Americans are concerned, this would be of some use, but I don’t see them showing any interest in meeting on Ukraine or any other matter.
","In a lengthy April 25 interview, Lavrov somewhat dialed back previous nuclear threats. Although
there was a real danger of nuclear war, Russia continued to stand behind the principle of the January
2022 P5 statement that nuclear war was inadmissible, he explained. All five [UN Security Council] leaders signed the declaration on the inadmissibility of nuclear
war. This is our principled position. ... Now the risks are very significant. I don’t want to artificially inflate these risks. ... The danger is serious, real. It cannot be underestimated. During the
Cuban Missile Crisis, there were not many “written” rules. But the rules of conduct were clear
enough. Moscow understood how Washington behaved. Washington understood how Moscow
behaved. Now there are few rules. ... At the same time, the other instruments of arms control and
non-proliferation have been practically destroyed. ... The United States rejected almost all contacts because we were forced to defend the Russians in Ukraine. 229
Moreover, Lavrov complained that arms deliveries to Kyiv were “pouring oil on the fire.” The countries involved wanted to “force the Ukrainians to fight with Russia to the last soldier.” Like this, they
hoped, this conflict would drag on “longer, so that Russia … would suffer more and more,” Lavrov declared, emphasizing that these Western supplied weapons would “be a legitimate target for Russian
forces.” “Warehouses, including in the west of Ukraine, have become such a target more than once,”
he stressed. “How else? NATO is essentially going to war with Russia through a proxy and arming that
proxy,” added Lavrov","Lavrov: The risks of nuclear war are “very significant,” “serious” and
“real.” But: He does not want to “artificially inflate these risks.” And: It is Russia’s “principled
position” that nuclear war is inadmissible. Western arms deliveries to Ukraine are “pouring
oil on the fire.”

minister has backed Ukrainian strikes on military targets behind Russian lines, even if the weapons used have been supplied by the UK.

The UK’s armed forces minister James Heappey said on Tuesday there is “every chance” that Moscow’s forces will be repelled with the support being supplied to Kyiv by allies.

But he dismissed Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s claims that Western allies are “pouring oil on the fire” by providing Ukraine with firepower.

Mr Heappey said “of course” the UK backs reported strikes on fuel depots in Russia.

He told Times Radio it is “completely legitimate for Ukraine to be targeting in Russia’s depth in order to disrupt the logistics that if they weren’t disrupted would directly contribute to death and carnage on Ukrainian soil”.

And the minister said it is “not necessarily a problem” if British-donated weapons are used to hit sites on Russian soil after accepting that weapons now being supplied by allies to Ukraine have the range to be used over borders.

“There are lots of countries around the world that operate kit that they have imported from other countries; when those bits of kit are used we tend not to blame the country that manufactured it, you blame the country that fired it,” he added.

The comments mark a further strengthening of the UK’s position, as allies shift from caution against antagonising President Vladimir Putin to supplying more and more lethal aid.

Russian foreign minister Mr Lavrov has warned that the threat of nuclear conflict “should not be under-estimated”.

He accused Nato forces of “pouring oil on the fire” by providing weapons, as he warned against provoking “World War Three”.

But Mr Heappey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the chances of nuclear warfare are “vanishingly small”.

He told Mr Lavrov to “reflect” on the reason there is a war in Ukraine being that Russia invaded, telling Sky News: “All of this noise from Moscow about somehow their attack on Ukraine being a response to Nato aggression is just utter, utter nonsense.”

Mr Heappey has said there is “every chance” that the Ukrainians will see off the Russians in the invasion, arguing that Moscow’s victory in the east of Ukraine is not inevitable.

“We’ll see a conflict between two forces that are much more evenly balanced, where the Ukrainians have the advantage of defensive positions that have been dug in and prepared over the last eight years, and that’s going to make it an extraordinarily difficult nut for the Russians to crack,” he told Sky News.

“And with all the support that the Ukrainians are getting from around the world, there’s every chance the Ukrainians can see them off.”

Britain is sending a small number of Stormer armoured vehicles fitted with launchers for anti-aircraft missiles in the latest shipment to repel the Russians.

Germany is also expected to approve the delivery of Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine in a significant increase of support from Berlin.

In the UK, the Ministry of Defence said it has seen reports that the city of Kreminna, in the eastern region of Luhansk, has fallen to the Russians.

Amid “heavy fighting” in Izium and forces trying to advance to the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, the intelligence update said Moscow’s troops are “likely attempting to encircle heavily fortified” positions.

","Boris Johnson made similar comments, explaining that he did not see a risk of Moscow using nuclear
weapons, even if the Russian military experienced further defeats. “Given the massive Russian backing for what [Putin] is doing, given the apparent obliviousness of the Russian media about what is really happening in Ukraine, the paradox is that Putin has far more political space to back down, to
withdraw,” explained Johnson.232 His Minister of the Armed Forces James Heappey added, Lavrov’s
nuclear allusions were the “sort of bravado” that had been his “trademark over the course of 15 years
or so.” There was no “imminent risk of escalation,” Heappey stressed. “What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated,” though “it suits the Kremlin's narrative to claim that they are somehow in a confrontation with NATO,” he added.233 The risk of nuclear war was “vanishingly small.”234 Nor did Heappey see any particular risk of escalation should British weapons be used
against targets in Russia. “There are lots of countries around the world that operate kit that they have
imported from other countries; when those bits of kit are used we tend not to blame the country that
manufactured it, you blame the country that fired it,” he explained","Johnson: No risk of Moscow using nuclear weapons.

2022-04-27,"PRESS SECRETARY JOHN F. KIRBY: OK. I don't have a whole lot at the top. I do want to announce that tomorrow Secretary will be welcoming his Canadian counterpart, the Canadian Minister of National Defense Anita Anand here at the Pentagon. They just had a chance to speak yesterday, I think it was yesterday in Ramstein, at the Ukraine Consultative - Defense Consultative Meeting. 

So, we're delighted to be able to welcome her here into the Pentagon, her and her staff. And as you can imagine, there'll be a lot of things to discuss, obviously, what's going on in Ukraine. But also, our shared NORAD responsibilities, the Arctic, the Indo Pacific, there's a lot on the agenda. 

And we're very much looking forward to welcoming her and her team here tomorrow. And with that, Bob.

Q: A couple of quick questions on Moldova, is there any more clarity that you're aware of what the explosions in the region?

MR. KIRBY: No, I'm afraid we don't have much more on that Bob. And no clear indication here of exactly what happened.

Q: OK. The other question I have for you is regarding the howitzers that you're sending to Ukraine, the 90. Can you update us on where that stands? And are you confident that they’ll get enough of them there fast enough to make a difference in this offensive?

MR. KIRBY: I would say today, without giving whole numbers more than half of those howitzers are in Ukraine.

Q: Are in Ukraine?

MR. KIRBY: Are in Ukraine.

Q: And the training part of it is that...

MR. KIRBY: Well, they're on a second tranche of training here, Bob. You know, we finished up earlier this week, the first tranche of more than 50 trainers that are going to go in and train their teammates. And we're working on a second tranche here of training. I'm not sure if that second tranche has actually begun yet, I'll have to check and get back to you on that. 

But there was another tranche of more than 50 that we're going to go through training in the same location outside Ukraine. And then we are also - part of the discussion yesterday was to explore additional training opportunities on that system as well as other systems.

And so, we're just not in a position where we can announce anything, but the training is ongoing.

Q: The first fifty are done you say?

MR. KIRBY: Yes, they finished up earlier this week. Travis.

Q: Thanks, John, I wanted to ask you about recruiting. And I know that that's an issue usually handled by the services. But our colleague over on the Hill, Leo Shane is reporting that at a SASC hearing today, the Chair said that he's worried that we're in the early days of a long-term threat to the all-volunteer force. 

He said, every single metric tracking the military recruiting environment is going in the wrong direction. And so, I'm just wondering if this is something that's risen to the Secretary's level? Is he concerned? And does this need some kind of global approach within the department?

MR. KIRBY: It absolutely has risen to the Secretary's attention. In fact, I think it was last week, he had a chance to meet with the Service Secretaries. Obviously, they meet on multiple topics, one of the topics was recruiting because he wanted an update from them on where they are. And while none of the services were, you know, reported sort of in extremis conditions. 

Clearly, the Service Secretaries and the services are - aren't taking anything for granted in the recruiting environment. And it can be a tough environment, particularly when COVID has prevented recruiters from being able to do that face-to-face contact that you want to have. And that's beginning to loosen up now as we start to come out of the pandemic, but it had a huge effect on their ability just to connect with people. 

And the economy, which is - continues to improve and so you've seen the unemployment numbers yourself. So, there's plenty of jobs out there, and then there's always the issue, which has been almost a perennial issue now for much of the last 20 years is just the number of young Americans who can meet the basic standards to come in. That continues to be a challenge. 

So, look, recruiting numbers are often lag indicators - lagging indicators, you know, when you start to really get down to bare metal, then you're well past the problem set, and the numbers are probably going to get worse. I would let the services speak for where they are. The Secretary doesn't want to get us down to bare metal. And he wants to make sure that we're staying ahead of recruiting challenges because they're real. 

And so, we're working on that. And the Secretary is, is 100 percent committed to making sure that we continue to recruit the best possible force that we can for the American people, for the defense of that country. Whether or not he thinks there's some sort of overarching policy, umbrella. I mean, he believes that as Secretary of Defense, he has enough authorities to direct the services with respect to every aspect of how they spend budget to include recruiting and retention. 

So, he's very comfortable with his own authorities here. And he also recognizes that the services have unique recruiting demands, not just in terms of numbers, but in terms of skill sets. And he doesn't want to overly dictate to them how they manage their workforce, but it is absolutely on his mind. He's he has had a good session with the Service Secretaries. And I fully expect that there'll be more going forward.

Q: Well, we've seen the services rolling out bonuses, in efforts to bring people in. Was there a sense at that meeting that there needs to be a kind of like a rethink about how the military is doing this? That whatever it's been doing isn't quite working and we need to figure out a better way?

MR. KIRBY: I think each service is working that through in real time. And again, the Secretary didn't you know, expect from them, you know, fingertip feel solutions right in the moment. He wanted it to express that key to his concerned, making sure that we - that recruiting is healthy going forward. 

He wanted to get their assessments, and they - each - and all let them, and the services speak for themselves, but they each offered him a view of where they are in recruiting. And I think all participants agreed that this is an issue we're constantly staying on top of and discussing going forward. But there's no - there was no individual solutions put forth in that discussion. 

 Courtney.

Q: Do you have any information about Trevor Reed, and whether it will come back to the DC area and get any kind of medical care in the military?

MR. KIRBY: At this time, I do not have information on Mr. Reed. I mean, obviously, we all at the department are glad to see him back and you know, be reunited with his family where he belongs. But this is really a State Department issue to speak to not a DoD issue.

Q: So reason I ask you this, it's pretty common if somebody's held hostage, and it wasn't necessarily hostage. But they are brought into military and medical care afterwards. So, do you have any indications at all that he's either eligible for that? Or if that's even under consideration?

MR. KIRBY: I would let the State Department and Mr. Reeds family speak to that being clearly Court. You know, if there was a, if there was a role we can play from a military medical perspective, we absolutely would do that. That's not unusual at all, but at this time, I just don't have much more detail on whatever medical care he's going to need and where that would be. 

But if there's an appropriate role for the United States military to play, in helping assess and restore him his health, we absolutely would do that. 
Phil.

Q: You've said for a long time that there are not US troops in Ukraine. With the return of diplomats, and there's a team there yesterday in Lviv. Is that still the case? Is that something you can still say? Or is it going to become, you know, are there going to be certain numbers of troops there to ensure diplomatic security?

MR. KIRBY: I think we're going to be having constant conversations here with our State Department colleagues about what their diplomatic activities are going to entail. And to what degree they might need support from the United States military and force protection mode. Keeping in mind, Phil, that they may not. So, we're just going to take this in steps. And we'll see where it goes. But as you and I speak here, I mean, nothing's changed about our support to U.S. diplomats.

Q: And secondly, you know, is there any sense after the conference in Ramstein yesterday that there is no - that the Ukrainians have enough munitions right now? And artillery, and everything they need to repel the Russians in the southeast? Or is that still to be determined?

MR. KIRBY: It's a kinetic - it's an active kinetic fight there in the Donbass every single day, including this day. And as you, I think, heard when you were in Ramstein, I mean, there are real needs that the Ukrainians have to stay active in that fight. And you heard the Secretary say very clearly that we're going to be trying to meet those needs as best we can, not just from the United States, but other countries as well, that includes munitions. 

So, what I can tell you, Phil, is that munitions continue to flow into Ukraine. That the United States is helping coordinate. That continues to flow in there, including while we were overseas just over the last couple of days. And that - and efforts to get those munitions into Ukrainian hands will also continue going forward as they are in a very active fight. 

You're asking, do they have enough? I mean, I think that question is something that changes every hour, depending on their rate of consumption and what is actually going on the battlefield. So, it'd be a difficult question for me to answer you know, here thousands of miles away at the Pentagon. All I can tell you is that we know they're expending rounds every single day of all different types and calibers. 

And we're doing everything we can. The flow continues to make sure that they can stay in the fight.

Q: Today, or right now, even a former master sergeant is meeting with the Secretary of the Army. He is waiting for compensation for misdiagnosis while he was in the Army. Does the Pentagon have a response to his case in the hundreds of others who are waiting for their repayments here? And why is this taking so long to happen?

MR. KIRBY: Look, I won't talk about the specific case that you're speaking of. And that's really for the Army to speak to. I'm aware that there is going to be a meeting this afternoon if it hasn't already happened. And again, I'll let the Army and the family speak to that. As you know, the Military Claims Act is governed by law, we follow the law. 

And we do the best we can in every case, to make sure that all claims are treated fairly and appropriately and judiciously. The Secretary takes that responsibility very, very seriously. I won't - I can't speak to the specifics of this individual claim, that wouldn't be appropriate here from our podium. But I know that the - that Army leadership is certainly mindful of this case. And as you rightly said, I mean, there's even a meeting today in the Army department. 

So, look, bottom line, we take our responsibilities under the Claims Act seriously. Nothing's more important to the Secretary than the health and wellbeing of our people and their families. And we - and that's a sacred obligation. But we have to follow the law. And we absolutely do in every case.

Q: Could there any way expedite it? Because for some of these people, they're running out of time.

MR. KIRBY: Again, it's governed by law, and in very strict, as you would expect, there would be. Procedure that has to be followed so that claims can be treated impartially and fairly. So while we want to certainly work claims as fast as we can, we don't want to go so fast that we miss something. And so it's - there has to be a process here, and we have to follow that process. Again, it's in the law, too. I mean, we obviously can't break or bend the law.

So, all I can tell you without getting into the specifics of this case, is we do take that seriously, and follow the law. And we can we treat every claim seriously and as judiciously as we can. 

Q: And if I may ask one on switching gears to the nuclear threat. Do you see a danger and not taking urgent threats of nuclear war seriously?

MR. KIRBY: Do I see a danger in not taking the threat seriously? The question presupposes that we aren't taking the threat seriously. And I think I might challenge that supposition there. You heard the Secretary got asked this question yesterday. And said very clearly that the rhetoric that we keep hearing from Russian leaders, and just recently was Minister Lavrov, raising the specter of nuclear confrontation is irresponsible. 

It's certainly not what you would expect from a modern nuclear power, nor should anybody expect from a modern nuclear power. Nobody wants to see this war escalate any more than it already has. Certainly, nobody wants to see, or nobody should want to see it escalate into the nuclear realm. And there's no reason that it should. Mr. Putin can do the right thing right now by ending the war, moving his forces out of Ukraine, sitting down in good faith with President Zelensky and coming up with a negotiated settlement. 

Now, clearly, he doesn't appear interested in doing that, because they're still fighting in the Donbas and in the south. Short of that, raising the specter of nuclear confrontation does nothing for the peace and security of the region, much less the people of Ukraine. And I think we can all understand that, that escalating this conflict and making it between the United States and Russia is not only not good for our national security or the Russian national security. It sure as heck isn't good for the people of Ukraine. 

And so again, I go back to what the Secretary said yesterday. It's irresponsible rhetoric. It's rhetoric, beneath what should be the level of conversation by a modern nuclear power. We monitor the threat every single day, including today. And the Secretary remains comfortable that we have the appropriate strategic nuclear deterrent posture in place. 

Yes.

Q: John, two questions, one to follow up on Phil's. How tight are the supplies of non-standard ammunition, the kinds of things Ukraine military uses? And is really tight, is there a shortage? Is there - are there moves to step up manufacturing? This kind of stuff wasn't explained in the conference yesterday.

MR. KIRBY: Yes, no we're not going to talk about specific inventory levels for the Ukrainians. First of all, I'm not going to talk for Ukrainian inventories on anything. That's really a better question better put to them. And clearly, I think you can understand why we wouldn't necessarily find that level of information in detail in the public realm helpful to Ukraine right now, as they're in an active fight. 

There was a discussion yesterday, at the end of the day, the last session was all about the defense industrial base, not just from the United States, but from other countries that were represented there. And a - and to begin to get a grasp from an international view of what Ukraine's longer term defense needs might be in a post war environment specifically. 

That - it was meant to be a broaching session on that, so, you know, you heard the Secretary read out the meeting, I can't do better than he did yesterday. So, I can't give you an act of deliverable that came out of the defense industrial base discussion. But I think it's noteworthy that it was even had here, even while Ukraine is still involved in an active war. 

There was a discussion by 40 nations about their defense industrial bases and how those industrial bases could help address longer term, Ukrainian strategic defense needs going forward. But no actual decisions made yesterday that we can speak to.

Q: Do you know anything about whether the producers, the Western European countries who can produce non-standard ammunition are stepping up production?

MR. KIRBY: I think they're - each country is looking at that on their own. And I can't speak to all of them.

Q: And my second thing, different. Apparently, according to Russian videos and stuff like that. There were two - possibly two Bayraktar drones downed over Russia in the past day or two. I don't know if you could confirm that? And on top of that, there was a report that President Zelensky is asking U.S. for attack drone including MQ-1s and MQ-9s. Is there a possibility that the U.S. could supply those?

MR. KIRBY: Cannot confirm the reports of downed drones and Russia. I don't have anything on you - for you on that. And all I will tell you is we have been very transparent about what we are providing Ukraine -- very transparent. And we will continue to be transparent with you as decisions are made to provide capabilities to Ukraine going forward. 

And there will be foreign contributions and we will talk about them. I am not going to talk about from the podium deliberations that are ongoing with the Ukrainians about this or that capability. We talked to them every single day, including the last two days, and at the very senior levels, as well. 

And when there are decisions to announce and to speak to about capabilities that we're going to provide Ukraine, we’ll certainly do that. Yes.

Q: Follow up on nuclear. What is the level of concern in the department that Russia might use low-yield or a conventional nuclear weapon in eastern Ukraine?

MR. KIRBY: Low-yield or conventional nuclear weapons? I'm not sure I've ever heard it described as conventional. But I'm not going to again, speculate here about what Russia may or may not do with that or any other system. The rhetoric surrounding nuclear activity, particularly given that this war is now months old, and there has already been bloodshed and violence visited upon the Ukrainian people is irresponsible. 

It's irresponsible for a nuclear power to even broach that topic in part of this discussion. And, again, I'll go back to what I said before - we're monitoring every single day as best, we can. And we continue to see nothing that gives us cause to change our strategic nuclear deterrent posture. And we're confident that in our ability to defend the homeland from that perspective, as well as our allies and partners.

Q: And then, Secretary Austin back in Europe, said that they would like to see Russia weakened in a way that it will not be able to launch another this type of invasion against any other country. Do you think that the arms that the United States is currently providing Ukraine will be sufficient to weaken the Russians not to launch another invasion into Europe?

MR. KIRBY: The weapons and systems that the international community is providing Ukraine are designed to help Ukraine defend itself against the Russian invasion. And if you're asking me, have they been effective? I would just offer you look, we're at two months into this war. And Mr. Putin didn't take Kyiv. He didn't take Chernihiv. 

He hasn't taken Odessa. And instead of moving on three, why geographically separated lines of axes, now he's concentrating all his firing and forces in the East and in the south. So, he has achieved none of his strategic objectives. So, I think that's proof right there that the kinds of systems that are being provided to Ukraine have had an effect an inability on their self-defense needs. 

What the Secretary said yesterday, and I think he was very clear. And we've been clear from the very outset of this conflict. That we don't want to see Russia in a position to be able to do this again. That's what the Secretary was referring to. And there's nothing new there. We want to see Ukraine be able to defend itself. We want to see Ukraine win.

You heard the Secretary talk about that. They believe they can win and so did every other nation that was in Ramstein believes that they can win. And we don't want to see Russia in a position going forward, where they haven't suffered consequences for this unprovoked invasion. And I think that's what the Secretary was talking about. Yes, in the back there.

Q: Hey, John.

MR. KIRBY: Hey, Jay.

Q: On Monday, there was a $700 million tranche and about more than half of it was financing for allies in Eastern and Central Europe to backfill the equipment that they've been sending to Ukraine. I just want to ask you what, you know, why does the Pentagon think that this kind of backfill model is promising? What's the what's the benefit? 

MR. KIRBY: Look, I think - there's a lot of nations that are providing capability to Ukraine. And that provision is not risk free in every case. Nations are doing what they can, they're having to make some tough decisions. Some are just in a better position than others to give more. And so, I think it's the responsible thing for us to do to have conversation with these allies and partners about what their needs are going to be going forward as well. 

Q: Are their industrial base concerns as well? You know, after all, we're, these are - this is maybe Soviet gear getting back filled with, with American supplied.

MR. KIRBY: Not every case. I mean, right now the focus Joe is on making sure they can defend themselves in the fight they're in. And in a fight, they're in, they're still using non - what we call non-standard equipment and munitions, because that's, you know, that that's what they're trained on. That's what they've been procuring. 

That's what they've - they're used to, to operating with. Now, where this goes long term, in terms of what standard they're on, I don't think Ukraine's made a decision about that. And you can't really expect them to have made a decision right now while they're fighting for their lives. But the whole purpose of having a session yesterday on defense, industrial base health and vitality is because we know whatever happens here, however this war ends, the security landscape in Europe has changed. 

Not ‘is changing’, not ‘will change’, it's changed now based on what Mr. Putin has done. And so the Secretary thought it will be a useful exercise, because we're looking at our own industrial base, to ask other nations that were there yesterday, their assessment of their defense industrial base. And the degree to which there might need to be changes in terms of production of certain systems or not, or accelerations or not. 

Not just based on how to help Ukraine long term, but also to make sure that they can look after their own national security. And so those discussions are ongoing. And I mean, I'm not going to get ahead of where we are. But in terms of - and this is a really important point. In terms of what Ukraine's military looks like, in a post-war environment, that's up to Ukraine to decide. 

They get to decide what systems they want to buy and use. And we'll just - we're just not there yet. We'll see what kinds of decisions they want to make, you know, when they're not actively trying to fend off an invasion. We also have to be, you know, we have a defense industrial base to that we have to look after. And so, we've had meetings now with CEOs about some of the very specific systems that we've been providing Ukraine, javelin stingers, the switchblades. 

And the Secretary wants to keep that dialogue going with the defense industry as well, on those and maybe even other systems. Because we certainly think that now that the focus is on the Donbas, this could become a more prolonged conflict. And we want to make sure that our own defense industrial base can continue to support our needs, as well as supporting our efforts to support Ukraine's needs. 

It's a really weird way of saying it. But…Mike.

Q: John does the administration believe that Israel should provide the Iron Dome System to Ukraine? And if so, are they doing anything to encourage them to do that?

MR. KIRBY: The United States believes that every nation that provides equipment and systems to Ukraine should do it according to their own dictates. These are sovereign decisions, Mike. They're sovereign decisions and we respect that. 

Jim.

Q: John, the Secretary ordered thousands of U.S. troops over to defend the Eastern Flank of NATO. Has there been any sort of discussion on how long that deployment is going to be? And if it would be rotational following on?

MR. KIRBY: There's been no redeployments as yet of the additional forces that we have sent to Europe, air, maritime, and ground. Now there's been - I shouldn't say there's been no -some ships have come home. Some squadrons have come home. But I mean, in terms of the ground forces, in particular, they're still there. 

The Secretary is in constant communication with General Wolters, as well as in the case of the Army that the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff about and the Chairman about what that needs to look like going forward. So, I don't have any announcements for you in terms of redeployment of like the 82nd, for instance, which is where I think you were kind of getting at. But - and right now, our footprint in Europe, which is now over 100,000, is both permanently based and rotational and temporary. 

And we're still working our way through what that's going to look like in coming months. I mean, clearly, at some point, if we're going to have to make a decision about the 82nd, for instance. And whether they're replaced or not, that - we're just not there yet. 

Q: Is that something that probably will wait until the summit in Madrid?

MR. KIRBY: I don't - I wouldn't peg it to Madrid, necessarily. The Secretary and the chairman look at force posture every day. And he - there are decisions that come up to the Secretary every week, about force posture around the world, but including in Europe. And so, they look at this continually. 

And he just hasn't there been a decision about other redeployments or replacements just yet. I will say, though, that and we're not at the point now where this is happening. But back to my point to Jim, I mean, the security environment has changed now in Europe. 

And so, the Secretary does believe that it's - that it would be healthy for leadership here at the department to take a look at our European posture going forward, and what that should look like. Now that's really not a discussion, that's going to be a series of discussions to include consultations with allies and partners. 

You can't just take for granted that you can talk to a bunch of soldiers in one country or another. You kind of have to talk to the host nation. And so those kinds of consultations haven't started yet, but I can tell you that the Secretary wants us to start thinking about what a European footprint should look like going forward because again, the landscape is definitely changed. 

Let me - I haven't gotten anybody on the phone yet. Dan Lamothe.

Q: Ah, good afternoon, John. The Canadians announced a day or two ago that they were going to be sending some triple-seven artillery rounds, I'm sorry, triple-seven artillery pieces, and also from the Excalibur rounds specifically. That's an American capability, it occurred to me, the Pentagon might be sending those as well. 

Can you clarify if that's the case? And then speak more broadly to Pentagon efforts to send precision artillery rounds, specifically? Thanks.

MR. KIRBY: Yes. Dan, I think, again, we've been very transparent about what we're sending. You can see it up on our website. And I'm not going to go beyond that. I mean, what we've said, we're sending triple seven howitzers. And I told Bob earlier, I mean, we - more than half of them are already in Ukraine, and they're continuing to move. 

But - and obviously, we've talked about, you know, 155-millimeter rounds to go with those howitzers, and they continue to flow into Ukraine. I mean, between the two tranches, between PDA seven and eight you're talking about almost 190,000 rounds total of 155-millimeter artillery. 

But I'm not going to go beyond that in terms of specificity. John Ismay.

Q: Hi there. One of my Capitol Hill colleagues flagged that there's a Lend Lease Bill for Ukraine and maybe heading to the President's desk for signature later this week. And I want to know if there's been a discussion about how this could possibly offer any additional permissions that the Pentagon doesn't already have now?

MR. KIRBY: John, great question. But I'm not going to get ahead of pending legislation. And I'm certainly not going to get ahead of the President's decision with respect to that. What our focus is right now is on meeting our responsibilities under the Presidential drawdown authorities that we're executing, as we speak. 

And looking ahead, what - about future drawdown authority and what that could look like working with Congress. And again, I don't want to get ahead of where we are in the decision-making process. Clearly, one of the things that Secretary took away from his time, both with President Zelensky in Kyiv as well as in Ramstein with 40 nations represented is that Ukraine does still have acute needs. 

There is a lot that the nations around the world can do to meet those needs. And we're going to keep looking for creative solutions to do that. But I'm just not going to get ahead of the legislative process right now. Ryo.

Q: Thanks.

Q: I want to ask you about U.S.- Japan, military exercises. That earlier this week they North Korean government said, if Japan expands the military exercises with the United States, near North Korea territory, North Korea will take a retaliatory measure. How much will you take North Korea's warning into account when you decide the scope and schedule military exercises with Japan?

MR. KIRBY: We will operate, train, fly, sail, we're international law allows us to do that Ryo. I'm not going to talk about specific training event scenarios. Japan's a treaty ally. We take our commitments, our security commitments to Japan very, very seriously. And Japan, should be the one speaking appropriately to the exercises that are conducted in and around Japan.

Q: The U.S. and Japan have focused mainly on defending the southern part of Japan, and addressing the threat posed by China. But as the threat of North Korea is increasing, do you think the U.S. and Japan needed to pay more attention to the northern part of Japan and allocate more resources to the north?

MR. KIRBY: Again, I would refer you to Tokyo to speak to about their self-defense needs. We have a very robust training regimen with Japan, a very strong military to military relationship. Exercises and training events are constantly monitored and changed as appropriate, not just to potential threats, Ryo, but to the kinds of capabilities you want to improve. 

That's why you do exercises to get better at things. And we're constantly having a conversation with Japan about what that could look like. But again, I'd let Japan speak to Japan's defense needs. That's really their responsibility, and appropriately so. Japan, as you know, I mean, was a participant in yesterday's meeting. 

I mean, they also recognize the threat to the rules-based order that Russia represents and their invasion of Ukraine, and they take that seriously. We were glad to see them participate. Sam LaGrone.

Q: Hey, John, just to clarify on Phil's question from earlier, so are you saying there are not U.S. Marines pulling embassy security in Ukraine right now?

MR. KIRBY: The specifics of force protection, Sam just not going to do it. We let - I'll let the State Department speak to what their diplomatic activities look like. But I would be surprised if they also want to talk about security right now. What I said to Phil was, if there's a need for U.S. military support, then you know, we'll have that discussion with the State Department, and we have supported our diplomats in the past. 

We know that's at least not a total U.S. military responsibility. But that there may be a role for that. But I got nothing. I got nothing for you on that today. Yes. One more

Q: Thanks. I have a follow up on the medical malpractice. You know, these claims have been filed for over two years now. So, hundreds of service members, over $2 billion worth of claims are in limbo right now. And it appears the services aren't processing the claims because they're waiting for policy guidance from the Secretary. 

So, I just wanted to try again, see if you could be a little bit more specific as to why that hasn't happened? You know, we've been waiting for that for over a year.

MR. KIRBY: I'm not aware that there was a need for guidance from the Secretary here. There - once a claim is properly filed and received the service that ran the military medical treatment facility reviews it. Claims are reviewed in a non-adversarial manner to assess liability and pay meritorious claims. 

Settlements are offered based on the best assessment of liability and damages. Claimants have access to the medical records and opportunities to submit additional information through their process. So, again, the services run this claims process. And as I said, we take it seriously. And we also have to follow the law and doing it. 

Q: So, do you have any sense of why they're not being processed?

MR. KIRBY: I don't. And I think you have to talk to the services and each individual case for that. Look, we take it seriously. We know that there should be a legitimate claims process and there is, and it's legislated, and we have to follow the law. 

But we absolutely believe that it's an obligation of ours to take this seriously and we do but it's done by the services, and I'd refer you back to them individually. OK. Thanks, everybody.
","In an April 27 briefing, Pentagon spokesperson Kirby condemned Russian nuclear rhetoric, including Lavrov’s recent remarks, as “irresponsible,” but refused to speculate on a potential Russian nuclear use.

expect from a modern nuclear power... Certainly, nobody wants to see, or nobody should want to

2022-04-27,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday warned of a “lightning fast” response if any nation interferes in its war in Ukraine, according to multiple reports.

Putin made the threat against any country that creates “strategic threats for Russia,” CNBC reports.

“If someone intends to intervene on what is happening from the outside and creates unacceptable strategic threats for us, then they should know that our response to oncoming strikes will be swift, lightning fast,” Putin added while speaking in Saint Petersburg, reports CNN.

“We have all the tools for this, ones that no one can brag about, and we won’t brag — we will use them if needed — and I want everyone to know this. All the decisions have been made in this regard,” said Putin.

A mention in his remarks of “instruments [to respond] that no one can brag about” is reportedly speculated to be a reference to the Russia’s supply of intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons.
Russia cut off natural gas suddenly to two NATO countries, Bulgaria and Poland, on Wednesday, in what is believed to be an attempt to punish and divide the West for its support of Ukraine.

This maneuver could push Poland and Bulgaria to ration their gas supplies and further damage their economies. However, it may also hurt Russia’s ability to fund the costly war on Ukraine.

Poland, for example, has been working to store other supplies of gas and is not in immediate trouble. The Russian state-owned company Gazprom said it shut off Polish supply because the country refused to pay in rubles, as Putin demanded.

The Kremlin has warned that other countries “unfriendly” to Russia could be next, causing European Union countries to worry, especially Germany and Italy, which buy large supplies of Russian energy.

However, the EU countries have been working to reduce their dependence on Russian energy and bolster other gas supplies.

","On the same day, Putin issued another veiled nuclear threat, warning third parties against interfering
in the war in Ukraine. This would trigger an immediate reaction.

2022-04-28,"The Russian war on Ukraine has “driven US-Russia relations into the depths,” US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan told CNN on Thursday.

Although the top envoy did not say that the relationship between Washington and Moscow was at its absolute lowest point, Sullivan noted that it was “about as bad as it could be.”

“US-Russia relations were bad when I arrived here in January of 2020,” and “they have just gotten worse, spiraled downward, since then,” he said.

In an interview from Moscow with Alisyn Camerota on “CNN Newsroom,” Sullivan said there has been “very little engagement with the Russian government,” and his communications have focused on the detained US citizens and “the functioning of our embassy,” which is under sharp restrictions imposed by the Russian government.

On Wednesday, American Trevor Reed was released from Russian custody in a prisoner swap – a major development in which Sullivan was a key player. However, other Americans remain detained, including Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, the latter of whom has asked why he was “left behind.”

US ex-marine Trevor Reed, charged with attacking police, stands inside a defendants' cage during his verdict hearing at Moscow's Golovinsky district court on July 30, 2020. 
Inside the months-long effort to free Trevor Reed from detention in Russia
“Why was I left behind? While I am pleased Trevor is home with his family, I have been held on a fictitious charge of espionage for 40 months,” Whelan said in a statement to his parents and shared with CNN. “The world knows this charge was fabricated. Why hasn’t more been done to secure my release?”

Sullivan told CNN that he “couldn’t agree with Paul more in the sense that he has been convicted of a fabricated charge.”

“I’ve been advocating for his release both publicly in negotiations with the Russian government since before I got here as ambassador, when I was deputy secretary of state when Paul was originally arrested back in December of 2018,” he said.

“I’ve never relented in my advocacy for Paul in engagement with the Russian government, for Paul’s release,” Sullivan added, noting that “this case, Trevor’s case, is just one step.”

On the Russian war in Ukraine, Sullivan suggested it is up to one man – Russian President Vladimir Putin – to bring the brutal conflict to an end.

“This war started with a decision by President Putin; this war will end with a decision by President Putin,” he said, adding that the United States is “going to do all we can to make sure that that decision is a strategic defeat for him and his government, and not a victory for him in Ukraine.”

“And my reaction on the other side of the table is astonishment,” Sullivan said. “And unfortunately, what we’ve seen most recently is, at the most senior levels of the US government, an escalation of that rhetoric.”

Sullivan said the US has ratcheted down in response, noting that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin had paused and then canceled a missile test despite preplanning and notifying the Russian government.

“We do not engage in irresponsible rhetoric with respect to nuclear weapons,” Sullivan told CNN.

The US is “prepared to deter nuclear aggression against the United States,” he added.

“We won’t succumb to nuclear blackmail, but we won’t tolerate nuclear saber rattling and nuclear brinksmanship,” he said.","The following day, on April 28, US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan showed himself and Washington undeterred by this renewed Russian threat making, instead confirming the new broader US
goals in the war as laid out by previous US statements. Accordingly, Washington would “do all” it
could to ensure that the Russian decision to invade was “a strategic defeat for [Putin] and his government, and not a victory for him in Ukraine.” While Russia’s nuclear rhetoric was not new, it had recently escalated in “a dramatically irresponsible way,” noted Sullivan. Washington by contrast was
not engaging in “irresponsible rhetoric with respect to nuclear weapons” and was “prepared to deter nuclear aggression against the United States.” Hence: “We won’t succumb to nuclear blackmail,” nor
“tolerate nuclear saber rattling and nuclear brinksmanship,” Sullivan concluded","Sullivan: “We won’t succumb to nuclear blackmail,” nor “tolerate nuclear saber rattling and nuclear brinksmanship.”",w,W,
2022-04-28,"THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, everybody.  Good morning.  I just signed a request to Congress for critical security, economic, and humanitarian assistance to help Ukraine continue to counter Putin’s aggression and — at a very pivotal moment.

We need this bill to support Ukraine in its fight for freedom.  And our NATO Allies, our EU partners — they’re going to pay their fair share of the costs as well, but we have to do this.  We have to do our part as well, leading the Alliance.

     The cost of this fight is not cheap, but caving to aggression is going to be more costly if we allow it to happen. 

We either back the Ukrainian people as they defend their country or we stand by as the Russians continue their atrocities and aggression in Ukraine. 

Every day — every day, the Ukrainians pay for the — a price with — and the price they pay is with their lives for this fight. 

So, we need to contribute arms, funding, ammunition, and the economic support to make their courage and sacrifice have purpose so they can continue this fight and do what they’re doing.

It’s critical this funding gets approved and approved as quickly as possible.

You know, long before Russia lost i- — launched its brutal invasion, I — I made clear how the United States would respond.  I predicted they would invade, and they surely did.

     We said we’d not send U.S. troops to fight Russian troops in Ukraine, but we would provide robust military assistance and try to unify the Western world against Russia’s aggression.

     I said I would impose powerful sanctions on Russia and that we’d destroy and develop — we’d destroy this myth that somehow they could continue to move without the rest of the world acting; that we’d deploy additional forces to defend NATO territory, particularly in the east, along the Russian and Belarus borders.

That’s exactly — that’s exactly what we said we would do, and we did.

But despite the disturbing rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin, the facts are plain for everybody to see.  We’re not attacking Russia; we’re helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression.

And just as Putin chose to launch this brutal invasion, he could make the choice to end this brutal invasion.

Russia is the aggressor.  No if, ands, or buts about it.  Russia is the aggressor.  And the world must and will hold Russia accountable.

Russia’s continued assault on — is yielding immense human costs.

We’ve seen — we’ve seen them leave behind horrifying evidence of their atrocities and war crimes in the areas they tried to control.

And as long as the assaults and atrocities continue, we’re going to continue to supply military assistance.


     And I might note, parenthetically: You know, there’s a dinner this weekend to celebrate the press.  Think of what the American press has done — the courage it has taken to stay in these warzones, the courage it has taken to report every single day.

     I’ve always had respect for the press, but I can’t tell you how much respect I have watching — watching them in these zones where they’re under fire, risking their own lives to make sure the world hears the truth.

     Imagine if we weren’t getting that information.  It’d be a different world.  It’d be a different circumstance.
 

In the past two months, Russia launched its brutal attack and has moved weapons and equipment to Ukraine at — we’ve moved — we’ve moved weapons and equipment to Ukraine at record speed.

Thanks to the aid we’ve provided, Russian forces have been forced to retreat from Kyiv.  It doesn’t mean they’re not going to try to come back, but they’ve retreated thus far.

We’ve sent thousands of anti-armor, anti-[air] missiles, helicopters, drones, grenade launchers, machine guns, rifles, radar systems, more than 50 million rounds of ammunition.  The United States alone has provided 10 anti-armor systems for every Russian tank that is in Ukraine — 10 to 1.

We’re providing Ukraine significant, timely intelligence to help them defend themselves against the Russian onslaught.

And we’re facilitating a significant flow of weapons and systems to Ukraine from our Allies and partners around the world, including tanks, artillery, and other weapons.

That support is moving with unprecedented speed.

Much — much of the new equipment we’ve announced in the past two mon- — two weeks has already gotten to Ukraine, where it can be put to direct use on the battlefield. 

However, we have almost exhausted what we call — the fancy phrase — the “drawdown authority” that Congress authorized Ukraine — authorized for Ukraine in a bipartisan spending bill last month.  Basically, we’re out of money.

And so, that’s why today, in order to sustain Ukraine as it — as it continues to fight, I’m sending Congress a supplemental budget request.

It’s going to keep weapons and ammunition flowing without interruption to the brave Ukrainian fighters and continue delivering economic and humanitarian assistance to the Ukrainian people.

This so-called supplemental funding addresses the needs of the Ukrainian military during the crucial weeks and months ahead.  And it begins — it begins to transition to longer-term security assistance that’s going to help Ukraine deter and continue to defend against Russian aggression.

This assistance would provide even more artillery, armored vehicles, anti-armor systems, anti-air capabilities that have been used so effectively thus far on the battlefield by the Ukrainian warriors. 

You know, and it’s going to deliver much-needed humanitarian assistance as well as food, water, medicines, shelter, and other aid to Ukrainians displaced by Russia’s war, and provide aid to those seeking refuge in other countries from Ukraine. 

It’s also going to help schools and hospitals open.  It’s going to allow pensions and social support to be paid to the Ukrainian people so they have something — something in their pocket.  It’s also going to provide critical resources to address food shortages around the globe. 

Ukraine — Ukraine was one of the world’s largest agriculture producers.  It typically grows 10 percent of all the wheat that’s shipped around the world. 

Putin has asserted sanctions are blocking food from Ukraine and Russia getting on the market — the sanctions we’ve imposed on Russia.  Simply not true.

Putin’s war, not sanctions, are impacting the harvest of food and disrupting the movement of that food by land and sea to nations around the globe that need it.

This funding is going to help ease rising food prices at home as well, and abroad, caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine.

It’s going to help support American farmers produce more crops like wheat and oilseed, which is good for rural America, good for the American consumer, and good for the world.

And this supplemental request will use the Defense Production Act to expand domestic production and reserve — and the reserve of critical materials — materials like nickel and lithium that have been disrupted by Putin’s war in Ukraine and that are necessary to make everything from defense systems to automobiles.

And I hope Congress — I hope Congress will move on this funding quickly.  I believe they will. 

I want to thank Congress — Democrats and Republicans — for their support of the people of Ukraine.

And next week, I will be in Alabama to visit a Lockheed Martin plant that manufactures the Javelin anti-tank missile we’ve been sending to Ukraine, and to thank the American workers — thank them — for producing the weapons that helped stop Russia’s advances in Ukrainian cities like Kyiv.

Their hard work has played a critical role in ensuring Putin’s strategic failure in Ukraine, and they should know that we know it. 

In addition to this supplemental funding, I’m also sending to Congress a comprehensive package of — that will enhance our underlying effort to accommodate [hold accountable] the Russian oligarchs and make sure we take their — take their ill-begotten gains.  Ha, we’re going to “accommodate” them.   We’re going to seize their yachts, their luxury homes, and other ill-begotten gains of Putin’s kleptoc- — yeah — kleptocracy and klep- — the guys who are the kleptocracies.  (Laughs.)  But these are bad guys.   

This legislative package strengthens our law enforcement capabilities to seize property linked to Russia’s kleptocracy. 

It’s going to create new, expedited procedures for forfeiture and seizure of these — of these properties.  And it’s going to ensure that when the oligarchs’ assets are sold off, funds can be used directly to remedy the harm Russia caused in their help — and help build Ukraine.

Additionally, yesterday, Ru- — Russia threatened two of our Allies with a cut-off of energy supplies. 

While America has ended all Russian fossil fuel imports because we are able to use our vast support — supply of power in our country, some European countries have faced more challenges in reducing their reliance on Russian fuel.

Russia has long claimed to be, quote, “the reliable source of energy” for the world.  No matter what the differences are, their customers are always going to be — be in good shape. 

But these actions prove that energy is not just a commodity that Russia sells to help meet other countries’ needs, but a weapon it will use to deploy against those who stand against their aggression.

So, let me be clear: We will not let Russia intimidate or blackmail their way out of these sanctions.  We will not allow them to use their oil and gas to avoid consequences for their aggression. 

We’re working with other nations — like Korea, Japan, Qatar, and others — to support our effort to help the European allies threatened by Russia with gas blackmail and their energy needs in other ways. 

Aggression will not win.  Threats will not win. 

This is just another reminder of the imperative for Europe and the world to move more and more of our power needs to clean energy. 

In the United States, we’re doing that right now.  Last year, we developed [deployed] more solar, wind, and battery storage than any year in our history — enough to power 56 million American homes.

Earlier this month, we acted to bolster the — our reli- –the reliance on our nuclear energy facilities, which generates more than half of our carbon-free power.  And we’re just getting started.  I look at this as a serious problem, but also an enormous opportunity — an opportunity. 

Bottom line: All these actions we’ve been taking are about the truth — this truth: Investing in Ukraine’s freedom and security is a small price to pay to punish Russian aggression, to lessen the risk of future conflicts.

You know, throughout our history, we’ve learned that when dictators do not pay the price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and engage in more aggression.  They keep moving.  And the costs, the threats to America and the world keep rising.

We can’t let this happen.

Our unity at home, our unity with our Allies and partners, and our unity with the Ukrainian people is sending an unmistakable message to Putin: You will never succeed in dominating Ukraine.

Finally, we’re going to continue to deliver critical support to Ukraine.  We must also not let our guard down in our fight against COVID-19 at home and abroad.  That’s why I’m, again, urging Congress to act on my request for $22.5 billion in emergency resources so the American people can continue to protect themselves from COVID-19.

The reason we were so successful in the past is because I was able to work with drug manufacturers to order significant quantities of material we needed ahead of time to get in the front of the line.  Without additional funding, we can’t preorder the amount of vaccines we need, and we risk losing our spot in line for vaccines that target multiple variants. 

We’re running out of supply for therapeutics like antiviral pills that we desperately need. 

Without additional funding, we’re unable to purchase the lifesaving treatment for the American people.  We’ve donated more vaccines and treatments to the world than all other nations in the world combined.  If the U.S. won’t do it, no one else is really going to step up and do it. 

Without additional funding, the United States won’t be able to help stop the spread around the world and close off ongoing suppor- — sources of the supply chain disruptions.

Look, let’s get both of these critical tasks done.  No delays, no excuses, just action now.  Now. 

Thank you all.  Thank you.

Q    Mr. President, what’s your message to refugees on —

Q    Mr. President, how worried are you — how worried are you by — go ahead.  No, you go.

Q    Okay.

THE PRESIDENT:  Watch your head, man.  You’re going to get hurt.  He’s turning that camera. 

Q    I’m in a tight spot here, Mr. President.

Q    He’s a gentleman.  Mr. President, I wanted to ask what your message is to Ukrainian refugees on the southwest border and those that are trying to flee Ukraine from the violence.

THE PRESIDENT:  We have made a direct means by which they can get from Europe, from Ukraine, directly to the United States, without going through the southern border.  In the meantime, in the southern border, we’re trying to work through and make sure they — it’s an orderly process, they’re able to get in. 

But just so you know, we have said there’s no need to go to the southern border; fly directly to the United States.  We set up a mechanism whereby they can come directly with a visa.

Q    Mr. President, thank you.  How worried are you by a growing number of Russian comments in the media and amongst some of their officials painting this conflict as actually already a conflict between NATO, the U.S., and Russia?  And they’re painting in very alarmist terms, talking of nuclear weapons, saying it’s a life-or-death struggle, et cetera. 

And just separately — well, connected to that: Lavrov himself self says it’s already a proxy war — not a direct war but a proxy war.  So are either of those two things true?  And do they worry you, those things?

THE PRESIDENT:  They’re not true.  They do concern me because it shows the desperation that Russia is feeling about their abject failure in being able to do what they set out to do in the first instance.

And so, it — I think it’s more of a reflection not of the truth but of their failure.  And so, instead of saying that the — the Ukrainians, equipped with some capability to resist Russian forces, are doing this, they’ve got to say — tell their people the United States and all of NATO is engaged in — in taking out Russian troops and tanks, et cetera. 

So, it’s — number one, it’s an excuse for their failure.  But number two, it’s also, if they really mean it, it’s — it’s — no — no one should be making idle comments about the use of nuclear weapons or the possibility that they’d use that.  It’s irresponsible.

     Q    Mr. President, back on the border, Title 42.  A number of your Democratic friends are pressuring the White House

to maintain that policy.  Can you give us a straight answer on whether you’re going to — whether you’re going to heed that request or you’re going to get rid of it?

THE PRESIDENT:  I can give you a straight answer.  We had proposed to eliminate that policy by the end of May.  The Court has said we can’t so far.  And what the Court says, we’re going to do.  The Court could come along and say we cannot do that, and that’s it.

Q    Mr. President, you say that this is not a proxy war, but Russia clearly disagrees.  They say that war means war.  So how concerned are you that they may start to act accordingly, even if you disagree?

THE PRESIDENT:  We are prepared for whatever they do.

Q    What options do you have to ensure Poland and Bulgaria have sufficient supplies of gas?

THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, as you know, Poland has indicated they have significant reserves of gas that they have planned for, as does — not as much, but as does Bulgaria.  And we have worked with our allies, from Japan on, to say that we may divert our sale of the natural gas that we’re sending to those countries and divert it directly to Poland and Bulgaria.

So, I — you know, that’s the most I can tell you right now.

Q    Sir, how concerned are you about a recession, given the GDP report today showed a contraction of 1.4 percent in the first quarter?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I’m not concerned about a recession.  I mean, you’re always concerned about a recession, but the GDP, you know, fell to 1.4 percent. 

But here’s the deal: We’re also had — last quarter, consumer spending and business investment and residential investment increased at significant rates, both for leisure as well as hard products, number one.

Number two, the — we are — unemployment is the lowest rate since 1970.  A record 4.5 million businesses were created last year.  We’re in a situation where the — you know, we have a very different view than Senator Scott and Republicans that want to raise taxes on the middle-class families and want to include half of small-business owners in that. 

So, I think we’re — what you’re seeing is enormous growth in the country that was affected by everything from COVID and the COVID blockages that we — occurred along the way.

Now, you always have to be taking a look.  And no one is predicting a recession now.  They’re predicting — or some are predicting there may be recession in 2023.  I’m concerned about it, but I know one thing: that, you know, if our Republican friends are really interested in doing something about dealing with the economic growth, they should help us continue to lower the deficit, which we’ve done last year — over $350 billion. 

They should be willing to work with us to have a tax code that is actually one that works and everybody pays their fair share.  And they should be in a position where you shouldn’t be raising taxes on middle-class folks.  You should be raising taxes on people who everyone acknowledges — and the vast majority of Republicans — aren’t paying their fair share.

I’ve said it a hundred times: You have — you know, 50 major corporations of the Fortune 500 companies made $40 billion last year and didn’t pay single penny.  No one under our proposal making under $400,000 a year will see a penny in their taxes go up.  Not one penny.

Q    What do you think about tying COVID aid to Ukraine aid?  Do you think COVID aid and Ukraine aid should be tied together in legislation?

THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don’t care how they tie — how they do it.  I’m sending them both up.  I mean, I — they can do it separately or together.  But we need them both.

Q    Mr. President, Majority Leader Schumer said yesterday that you’re, quote, “getting closer” to using executive authority to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt.  Can you confirm that?  What exactly are you looking to — plan to do here in the coming —

THE PRESIDENT:  You mean my spokesman said that?

Q    Majority Leader Schumer.

THE PRESIDENT:  Look, number one, one of — the first thing we did was reform the system that was in place that didn’t work for anybody that allowed people to write off debt if they engaged in public service.  We’ve almost a million — seven hundred and eighty-five — don’t hold me to the exact number; I’ll get the number — seven hundred and some thousand have had debt forgiven — their whole debt forgiven because of their work working in –either as teachers or other means by which they qualify.  And we continue to make that easier.

Secondly, I am considering dealing with some debt reduction.  I am not considering $50,000 debt reduction.  But I’m in the process of taking a hard look at whether or not there are going to — there will be additional debt forgiveness, and I’ll have an answer on that in the next couple of weeks.

Thank you.

","In parallel, also on April 28, Biden however appeared to implicitly acknowledge Russian concerns
over external interference in Ukraine. Even before the war he had “made clear” that Washington
would “[not] send US troops to fight Russian troops in Ukraine, but ... would provide robust military
assistance” and “try to unify the Western world against Russia’s aggression,” he explained. “Despite
the disturbing rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin, the facts are plain for everybody to see,” Biden declared. “We’re not attacking Russia; we’re helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression,”
including with significant intelligence and military assistance.
Yet, Biden rejected Russian claims that the war in Ukraine was a “life-or-death struggle” and a RussiaNATO “proxy war.” These statements were concerning, explained Biden, because they showed “the
desperation that Russia is feeling about their abject failure in being able to do what they set out to do
in the first instance.”

2022-04-29,"""Russia has never stopped its efforts to avoid a World War"", said the Foreign Minister of Moscow, Sergej Lavrov, interviewed by Giuseppe Brindisi for ""Zona Bianca"". For the first time, Putin's minister grants an interview to a European TV and attacks: ""Western media always misrepresent what we say"".
Will this war escalate into a nuclear war? - Lavrov replies: ""Western mass media and western politicians misrepresent what is said by Russian institutions. When people talk about threats and they ask me how real these threats are, I always answer like this: Russia has never stopped efforts to reach the agreements that will ensure that no war develops. We proposed to our American colleagues that they repeat what Gorbachev and Reagan said in 1987 and accept a statement confirming that a nuclear war would have no winners. We failed to convince the Trump administration but the Biden administration agreed. And in 2021 in Geneva Putin and Biden accepted this statement, on our initiative. There was also a proposal from Putin to convene a summit of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council but the United States and Great Britain are slowing down"".

 

How does Russia consider Italy today? - Lavrov replies: Italy is in the front line among those who not only adopt anti-Russian sanctions but also all initiatives in this sense. Unfortunately at the beginning it was a surprise but now we are used to the fact that Italy can be this too, maybe this is the truth, I don't know. It seemed to me that the Italian people and Italy had a slightly different approach to the world and to fairness and that they knew how to distinguish white from black. I don't want to be wrong here, some statements by some Italian politicians not to mention the press have really gone beyond good diplomatic norms and journalistic ethics"".

 

Were the Russian missiles on Kiev during Guterres' visit a provocation? - Lavrov replies: ""We have always warned when President Putin spoke about the start of this special operation that the targets would be military infrastructures located in Ukraine. And which are used to put pressure on the civilian population and are a threat to Russia. We attack military targets to deprive Ukrainian radicals and the Ukrainian regime of strengthening its war position. That is clear.""

 

What are the unseen weapons announced by Putin? - Lavrov replies: ""Everyone knows, three years ago President Putin presented new ultrasonic weapons that began to be the focus of our attention after the United States tore up the agreement against nuclear weapons. Then to President Putin he asked why this document had not been signed and that it would allow for a world peace and president bush jr said they wanted out of the agreement because they were worried about Iran and North Korea.So the ultrasonic weapons were developed because the US missile shield will be aimed at Russia and China, which is why these weapons were developed.

 

Will Russia declare total war on May 9? - Lavrov replies: ""Our military does not plan actions based on a date. The rhythms depend on the need to minimize the risks for the civilian population and for the Russian military"".

 

Are there Western mercenaries in Ukraine? - Lavrov answers: ""All the polemics about the presence of mercenaries from the Wagner battalion serve to divert attention to what our Western colleagues are doing and the situation regarding the confrontation at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol and the hysterical wishes of Zelensky, his entourage and its Western partners to get these people out, has to do with the fact that there are Western mercenaries and officers among the ranks of Ukrainian radicals.""

 

Was there a massacre of civilians in Bucha? - Lavrov replies: ""On March 30, the Russian soldiers left Bucha. The mayor of Bucha declared victory saying that Bucha had returned to normal life and then after three days they began to show these dead. I don't want to go into this aspect because it is so evident that it is a fake that any observer can tell it from the first glance"".

 

Does Russia want Zelensky's surrender for peace? - Lavrov replies: ""Zelensky can bring peace if he stops giving criminal orders to his Nazi battalions and forces them to stop hostilities. We don't want him to surrender, we want him to give the order to stop hostilities and leave all civilians. Our goal is not regime change in Ukraine, this is an American specialty, usually they deal with this all over the world, while we only want to ensure the safety of people in the","The same day, April 29, Lavrov qualified his earlier statements about the risks of nuclear war. His
words had been taken out of context. In fact, he had stressed that Russia had been “champions of
making pledges by all nuclear countries never to start a nuclear war” and had repeatedly insisted on
such a declaration with other nuclear powers. Lavrov meant the declarations by Russia and the
United States, as well as by the P5 states, that a nuclear war could not be won, which he claimed had
grown out of Moscow’s initiative. Referring to a statement by Polish Prime Minister Mateusz
Morawiecki that Warsaw would “welcome” a deployment of US nuclear weapons to Poland, Lavrov
declared that it was Western states, like Poland and Ukraine, that were using dangerous nuclear rhetoric. We never were playing with such dangerous [nuclear rhetoric]. ... We should all insist on the
statements made by the P5, never ever there could be a nuclear war. But to make sure that this
is the case, the West must discipline speakers like our Ukrainian and Polish colleagues who see
no danger in playing with such very, very risky words.
In addition, Lavrov clarified that Russia did not see itself at war with NATO, but that Western arms
deliveries were a legitimate military target for Russian forces once they reached Ukrainian territory.
We do not see ourselves at war with NATO because this is exactly another step … to increase the
risks of what we just discussed. Unfortunately, NATO it seems considers itself to be at war with
Russia. NATO and the European Union leaders ... they bluntly, publicly and persistently say Putin
must fail, Russia must be defeated. ... As soon as these [Western] weapons are reaching Ukrainian territory, they are fair game for our special operation.246
Lavrov made similar remarks again on May 1, claiming that his nuclear statements had been misrepresented by Western media.
The Western mass media and Western politicians misrepresent what Russian institutions say.
When they talk about [nuclear] threats and ask me how real these threats are, I always answer
like this: Russia has never stopped making agreements that will ensure that war will not
emerge. We proposed to our American colleagues to repeat what Gorbachev and Reagan had
said in 1987 and to accept a declaration confirming that a nuclear war would have no winners.

2022-05-04,"Russia said Wednesday its forces had carried out simulated nuclear missile strikes in the western enclave of Kaliningrad on the border with the European Union.

The announcement came on the 70th day of Moscow's military action in the pro-Western country, with thousands killed and more than 13 million displaced.

After sending troops to Ukraine in late February, Russian President Vladimir Putin has made thinly veiled threats about Russia's willingness to deploy tactical nuclear weapons.

During Wednesday's war games, Russia practiced ""electronic launches"" of nuclear-capable Iskander mobile ballistic missile systems near Russia's borders with EU-members Lithuania and Poland, the defense ministry said in a statement.

The Russian forces practiced single and multiple strikes at targets imitating missile systems, airfields, defended infrastructure, military equipment and command posts, according to the statement.

The units involved also practiced ""actions in conditions of radiation and chemical contamination.""

More than 100 servicemen took part in the drills.

Russia placed nuclear forces on high alert shortly after the start of the invasion of Ukraine.

Putin has warned of a ""lightning fast"" retaliation if the West directly intervenes in the Ukraine conflict.

In recent days, Russian state-owned media has attempted to make the use of nuclear weapons more palatable to the public.

""For two weeks now, we have been hearing from our television screens that nuclear silos should be opened,"" Russian newspaper editor and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov said Tuesday.","Also on May 4, the Russian defense ministry announced it had simulated nuclear strikes in Kaliningrad. Around 100 Russian servicemen practiced “electronic launches” of nuclear-capable Iskander

avoid “a possible retaliatory strike,” the ministry added.251 It remained unclear, whether this was just
a routine exercise, or whether it involved any political signaling. ","Russia simulates electronic launches of nuclear-capable missiles in

2022-05-05,"Russia's envoy to the United States has told Newsweek that leaders of the U.S.-led NATO military alliance do not grasp the true gravity of a potential nuclear conflict erupting, as a tense war of words among powers looms over the ongoing fighting in Ukraine.

As officials and other influential figures of the U.S. and allied nations accuse the Kremlin of summoning the specter of nuclear war over NATO's support for Ukraine against Russia's devastating invasion, Moscow's ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, disparaged what he called ""a flurry of blatant misrepresentation of Russian officials' statements on our country's nuclear policy.""

In fact, he said it was those in the Western bloc that have proven irresponsible in their handling of what has been described as one of the most dangerous moments since the Cuban Missile Crisis six decades ago.

""The current generation of NATO politicians clearly does not take the nuclear threat seriously,"" Antonov told Newsweek.

Those who feel Russia was fueling the hysteria include top U.S. military leaders, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair General Mark A. Milley, who accused Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov of ""nuclear saber-rattling"" after an interview last month in which Moscow's top diplomat said that ""the danger is serious, real, and we must not underestimate it.""

And while U.S. officials cast Russia as the aggressor in escalating nuclear tensions, Antonov called these accusations ""baseless,"" and ""part of a propaganda campaign launched against Russia in response to the steps taken to neutralize threats to our national security emanating from the Ukrainian territory.""

He then outlined the ""conditions under which the use of nuclear weapons is possible"" as per Russia's official doctrine, which he said states that such weapons of mass destruction ""can be used in response to the use of WMD against Russia and its allies, or in the event of aggression against our country, when the very existence of the state is jeopardized.""

But Antonov believes his Western colleagues misread the weight of the nuclear risk, and that's why Russian officials ""have never stopped our efforts to reach agreements that will guarantee that a catastrophic confrontation will not be unleashed.""

""It is our country that in recent years has persistently proposed to American colleagues to affirm that there can be no winners in a nuclear war, thus it should never happen,"" Antonov said.

He noted the inclusion of this ""no winners"" principle in the joint Russia-U.S. statement adopted after the June 2021 summit held between President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and again among the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council in January of this year.

Even before the outbreak of Russia's war in Ukraine on February 24, however, strategic stability between the two nations that hold roughly 90% of the world's nuclear arsenal had eroded. Now, the conflict leaves the future of one of the last bastions of diplomacy between Moscow and Washington even more uncertain.

Next month will mark two decades since the U.S. exit from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, which for half a century marked a pioneering effort in reducing nuclear tensions in the heat of the Cold War. In August 2019, then-President Donald Trump abandoned the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, accusing Moscow of having first defied the agreement through the development of a new cruise missile in violation of the 310-3,420-mile range banned for land-launched weapons.


Since then, just one single yet significant treaty has bound the Russian and the U.S. nuclear arsenals, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START). After disagreements between Moscow and Washington threatened to allow this accord to collapse as well, Biden heeded Putin's offer to unconditionally extend it as one of the U.S. leader's first foreign policy measures after taking office last year.

Antonov called New START ""a universally recognized gold standard in the sphere of maintaining strategic stability and transparency between the major nuclear powers,"" and said that ""Russia has repeatedly drawn the attention of the United States that it is important to continue the joint work on an agreement that could replace New START and accommodate new realities of international security and development of military technologies.""

""Regrettably, Washington has unilaterally 'frozen' the bilateral strategic stability dialogue that was launched at the Geneva summit, thus jeopardizing the prospects of keeping the foundation of arms control in place,"" he added. ""Russia is ready to resume the consultations as soon as the United States is ready.""

The latest report submitted to Congress last month by the State Department assessed that both sides remained in compliance with New START.

The report also said that ""the United States has made clear its concerns about Russia's arsenal of theater-range nuclear weapons,"" which commonly refers to weapons armed with low-yield, tactical warheads, of which the U.S. Intelligence Community assesses Russia possesses between 1,000-2,000, a figure that is ""projected to grow.""

The U.S. has also developed low-yield warheads for use on submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and Pentagon officials have called for even more applications. U.S. Strategic Command chief Admiral Charles A. Richard told lawmakers in a letter last month that ""a non-ballistic, low-yield, non-treaty accountable system that is available without visible generation would be valuable.""

""The nation and our allies have not faced a crisis like Russia's invasion of Ukraine in over 30 years,"" Richard said. ""President Putin simultaneously invaded a sovereign nation while using thinly veiled nuclear threats to deter U.S. and NATO intervention.""

Neither Russia nor the U.S. has made any official changes to their respective nuclear policies since the war in Ukraine began more than two months ago. But rhetoric touched upon the potential for nuclear escalation in the opening days of the conflict, especially after Putin announced on February 27 that his nuclear forces were being placed ""on a special mode of combat duty.""

Antonov said Western nations ""misinterpreted the decision."" But Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu ""publicly explained that it was only about the work shifts of strategic forces commands which began to perform combat duties with reinforced personnel.""

The Russian diplomat said it was about responding to NATO's own nuclear moves on the continent.

""This means that Russia has increased its vigilance against the backdrop of extremely confrontational statements by Western countries,"" Antonov said, ""including NATO member states that possess nuclear weapons.""

Among the 30-state NATO alliance, three nations — France, the United Kingdom and the U.S. — possess nuclear weapons. The U.S. has also, however, deployed nuclear weapons to a number of other allied states including Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Turkey.

This nuclear sharing policy, through which such weapons remain solely under U.S. control, has prompted concerns from Russia that Ukraine's NATO aspirations could also bring nuclear weapons to the neighboring former Soviet republic seeking closer ties to the West.

As such, Antonov argued that ""it is not us who are the source of unhealthy speculations about unleashing a nuclear war.""

""They were initiated by the Kiev regime, which made no secret of its intentions to acquire military nuclear capabilities,"" Antonov said. ""In the same vein — statements made by Polish leaders about their readiness to deploy American nuclear weapons on their territory. And some hotheads on Capitol Hill even allege to call to use nuclear weapons against Russia.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has denied that his statements disparaging the 1994 Budapest Memorandum constituted a call for developing nuclear weapons. The deal, reached three years after Ukraine declared its independence, launched a process through which Kyiv surrendered Soviet-era nuclear weapons stored in Ukraine to Moscow in exchange for security assurances.

Russia's actions in Ukraine, which both U.S. and Ukrainian officials have argued amount to ""war crimes"" and even ""genocide,"" have nonetheless stirred a hawkishness in Washington and other allied capitals with calls for a greater NATO role in the conflict.

""Such rhetoric is accompanied by an unprecedented 'pumping' of Ukraine with modern NATO weapons,"" Antonov said. ""There are calls in the West to establish a no-fly zone, to bring alliance troops into Ukrainian territory under the disguise of peacekeepers.""

Antonov also reiterated Russian claims of ""an undeclared military biological program implemented with the support of the Pentagon in close proximity to the Russian borders."" U.S. officials have roundly rejected these allegations. A State Department official told Newsweek in March that such sites were actually ""Ukrainian diagnostic and biodefense laboratories,"" which ""are not biological weapons facilities.""

Competing narratives over the war in Ukraine continue to play out in the information space in both news outlets and social media, as both sides accuse one another of deliberately obscuring the truth to suit their respective interests.

Antonov says his concerns lie with the fact that, for all the World War II comparisons made, the current generation of leadership has not lived through the worst of humanity as did ""the Soviet and American leaders who went through the Second World War and knew from personal experience what the blood and torment of millions of people are.""

He then quoted two leaders who carried the world through the tense moments of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

""We are in a dire need of military intellectuals,"" Soviet Defense Minister Marshal Rodion Malinovsky wrote in his notebook, as cited by Antonov. ""Not just highly educated officers, but people who have mastered advanced culture of heart and spirit a humanistic outlook. Modern weapons of such destructive power cannot be entrusted to a skillful person who has only a firm grip. To wield it one needs a clear head capable of foreseeing consequences as well as a sensible heart. That is a mighty moral instinct.""

On the other side of the crisis was President John F. Kennedy, who in his famous 1963 address at American University offered a softer approach to relations with Moscow.

""If we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity,"" Kennedy said. ""For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal.""

With the world's top two nuclear powers again at the brink, Antonov said ""our country does not threaten the United States and its European allies, but, on the contrary, is making every effort to prevent the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.""

And he explained why the nuclear warnings from Moscow continue.

""We are compelled to warn of the emerging risks associated with the intervention of NATO states into the Russian special military operation,"" Antonov said.","Russian officials nonetheless continued to march back Putin’s nuclear narratives. On May 5, Russian
Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov explained that nuclear weapons could only “be used in response to the use of WMD against Russia and its allies, or in the event of aggression against our country, when the very existence of the state is jeopardized.” The decision to raise the alert level of Russia’s deterrent forces had been “misinterpreted” by the West. As had been explained by Shoigu, the
alert had been “only about the work shifts of strategic forces commands which began to perform combat duties with reinforced personnel.” This meant that Russia had “increased its vigilance against the
backdrop of extremely confrontational statements by Western countries, including NATO member
states that possess nuclear weapons,” clarified Antonov. He concluded: Russia did not “threaten the
United States and its European allies, but, on the contrary, is making every effort to prevent the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis. … We are compelled to warn of the emerging risks associated with the
intervention of NATO states into the Russian special military operation.”
In contrast, the “current generation of NATO politicians clearly does not take the nuclear threat seriously,” Antonov complained, pointing at what he saw as “a flurry of blatant misrepresentation of Russian officials’ statements on our country’s nuclear policy.” Moreover, he reiterated claims that Ukraine had intended to obtain nuclear weapons and had a biological weapons program, while criticizing Poland’s openness to host US nuclear weapons.
Nevertheless, Antonov also highlighted Russia’s interest in reaching “agreements that will guarantee
that a catastrophic confrontation will not be unleashed,” pointing to Moscow’s efforts to restate that
there could be no winners in a nuclear war with Biden and the other P5 states. Further, he stressed
the importance of the New START agreement as a “universally recognized gold standard in the sphere
of maintaining strategic stability and transparency between the major nuclear powers,” claiming that
“Russia has repeatedly drawn the attention of the United States that it is important to continue the
joint work on an agreement that could replace New START and accommodate new realities of international security and development of military technologies.”2","Antonov: Russia would only use nuclear weapons defensively, in
response to WMD use or when state existence is endangered.

2022-05-07,"Hello everyone, good morning, it's Friday, May 6, 2022. If you are one of those who are counting the days while waiting for the official announcement of Emmanuel Macron's new government, know that you can console yourself by watching the inauguration of the president this Saturday. The opportunity may be to scrutinize the faces of the ministers, to distinguish those who have the head to the task and those who are already elsewhere.

RENÉ, TOP START
UNITY IS STRENGTH. It is a show of unity offered by the three leaders of the presidential majority gathered yesterday in front of the press gathered at LREM HQ, sorry Renaissance. After days and even a few nights of negotiations, Edouard Philippe, Richard Ferrand and François Bayrou agreed yesterday on the creation of a “confederation” to embark on the battle for the legislative elections and articulate the future presidential majority. A first salvo of 187 candidates in total were invested yesterday, and a second is scheduled for Saturday.

We promise, we love each other. The majo tenors were full of praise for each other, commenting at length on the “good atmosphere” of the discussions. History especially to put an end to the rumors of tensions and outbursts of anger relayed lately by the press. Bayrou even said that he had never encountered a “better climate” during negotiations (as this photo taken by AFP very well illustrates).

Alliance, single party, association… It will ultimately be a confederation that will bring together Horizons, the Modem and La République en Marche, thus becoming “Together! – Presidential Majority”, under the presidency of Ferrand and the vice-presidency of Philippe and Bayrou. The idea of a large single party, sketched out by Emmanuel Macron on the evening of the first round of the presidential election, fizzled out. Bonus point for Bayrou and Philippe, the different parties of the conf 'will be able to create their own group in the National Assembly.

**A message from Bayer: When harnessed correctly, data and analytics hold great potential in healthcare. What if artificial intelligence could significantly advance clinical research? Learn more about the potential of using digital data in healthcare.**

As a reminder. Philippe resisted with all his might the creation of a large majo party that would engulf his own Horizons party created last October. This week, we also told you about his tough negotiations with the Mr. election of Macronie. The president's supporters criticized the former prime minister for eyeing too many constituencies, not hiding his own ambitions for 2027 well enough. Horizons personalities were sometimes better placed to win the legislative battle.

No mercy for newbies. In the end, it would seem that Philippe gave in on this point. It carries 58 constituencies, including a part concerning outgoing deputies already labeled Horizons. But the principle of “renewal of outgoing people” is part of the agreement, according to Gilles Boyer, Philippe’s closest support, who says he is “disappointed at not having obtained more”, having defended applications of “very good quality”. The Horizons candidates will therefore have to fight to conquer new territories.

The force of the war. It is of course the money, and there everyone sees the glass half full. The invested candidates will campaign on the banner of Ensemble! which means that the public funding obtained will be donated to Together! and not to the different parties of the majo. ""It's very solid,"" rejoices an LREM executive, unlike 2017 when each associated party had its own funding association. The parties will be linked to each other by funding, which will go through the confederation, making it difficult for any desire for independence in the medium term.

But, but, but. The money collected by Together! will be “automatically” donated to the various parties of the confederation, a device “which cannot be called into question” according to a majority adviser. Far from merging with LREM, Horizons would therefore keep all “its autonomy”, according to Boyer.

The king is dead, long live the king. Yesterday's conference was also an opportunity to unveil the change of name of the presidential party, which therefore becomes Renaissance. This name was also that of the list presented by the presidential majority to the Europeans of 2019. Unlike LREM, often accused of being ""an empty shell"", the Renaissance list is seen as ""a success story"", an alliance of more various, and the name has become a mark appreciated by activists, according to the LREM framework cited above.

Ministers and circos. In the first list of majority nominations, there are ten ministers: Olivier Dussopt (2nd district of Ardèche), Jean-Michel Blanquer (4th of Loiret), Brigitte Klinkert (1st of Haut-Rhin), Gérald Darmanin (10th of North), Laurent Pietraszewski (11th of North), Amélie de Montchalin (6th from Essonne), Clément Beaune (7th from Paris), Gabriel Attal (10th from Hauts-de-Seine), Emmanuelle Wargon (8th from Val-de-Marne), Elisabeth Borne (6th from Calvados). And a former minister, Manuel Valls (5th of the French abroad). On the other hand, Bruno Le Maire and Eric Dupond-Moretti announced yesterday that they would not be candidates.

LR keeps his distance. According to information from Figaro, only “five to seven” outgoing LR deputies will run with the presidential majority. We are far from the thirty elected LR Macron-compatibles concerned by the negotiations of the last few weeks. Damien Abad, the leader of LR deputies, yet at the center of speculation this week, would not be part of it.

BIG UNPACKING AT PS
NUPES IN ORBIT. It was after discussions of rare violence that the members of the National Council of the Socialist Party voted in favor of the union agreement with La France Insoumise, EELV and the PCF yesterday. Despite the rebellion that had been mounting for several days, a large majority of the 300 council members (62%) approved NUPES in a show of hands.

No but no. But the vote was the occasion for an unpacking of emotions and criticism against the architects of the agreement. According to our colleague from LCI on the spot, the former deputy Patrick Mennucci challenged the first secretary of the PS Olivier Faure by throwing to him: “You told me to leave the PS. There will be plenty of other first secretaries before I leave the PS”. Regional councilor François Kalfon accused management of dismissing local heavyweights who, like the president of the Occitanie region Carole Delga, support dissidents. “We are going to lose them all. We lost in advance. None of our five regional presidents support this agreement,” he said.

Manhandled. Defending his strategy before the vote, Olivier Faure spoke of a PS in 1972 which did not show as much ""gazelle modesty"" when it allied with an ""ultra-dominant"" Communist party, ""in direct line with the Kremlin"" and ally of Nasser in Egypt. In view of past statements by Jean-Luc Mélenchon on Russia and Vladimir Poutine, it is not certain that this historical reminder does not reassure everyone. His speech was interrupted by an activist.

Cold shower. Faure did not spare the sensitivities of elected officials during his speech, recalling that Anne Hidalgo only exceeded 3% in the first round of the presidential election in 12 constituencies despite a “courageous and determined” campaign. And he warned against threats from dissident candidates, arguing that territorial anchoring plays a lot less role during the legislative elections held in the wake of the presidential election. Faure described the vote as a ""moment of clarification"", the opportunity to dispel the ""doubt for five years"" maintained by the presence of former socialists in Macron's government and to clearly fit into ""the political space of the LEFT"".

Okay boomers. For those who would be surprised to see such a majority vote in favor of the agreement despite strong criticism in the press, a PS executive saw it as a partly “generational” conflict in the PS, recalling that Stéphane Le Foll, Bernard Cazeneuve , François Hollande and Julien Dray are “no longer active” in party bodies. ""We want to turn the page on Holland's five-year term, and look to the future,"" he said. The new left will meet on Saturday for the official launch of the Nupes in Aubervilliers.


AT THE PALACE
THE UNDERSIDE OF THE INVESTITURE. We now know the details of Emmanuel Macron's second investiture ceremony, which will take place on Saturday at the Elysée. Certain elements of the program are immutable: the proclamation of the results, the presentation of the collar of Grand Master of the Legion of Honor, the 21 cannon shots from the Invalides and the review of the troops. Nevertheless, “each president can have at heart to mark the ceremony in a singular way”, explains the Elysée to us. This can be done in particular through the speech delivered by the president, in particular to the presidents of the Senate and the National Assembly.

Guest list. Invitations were sent Wednesday evening. The relatives of the president as well as 450 officials were invited. Among them, Nicolas Sarkozy, François Hollande (who has already confirmed his arrival), Edouard Philippe. Will be present, as at each investiture, representatives of all political forces, unions, employers' and religious organizations as well as French institutions.

Civil society and military. Emmanuel Macron wished the presence of personalities from sectors of activity which marked the first five-year term, and which will probably mark the second: health personnel, sportsmen, elected officials, members of civil society. The president chose the soldiers he wanted to distinguish by inviting them to the review of the troops. Among them, special forces engaged in the Sahel, elements of the space command, forces linked to nuclear deterrence and elements of the parachute commando which participated in the evacuation of Kabul in 2021.

2022-05-09,"As “Victory Day” gets underway in Russia, speculation is rife that President Vladimir Putin could on Monday declare some kind of victory in Ukraine — or even all-out war. 

May 9 is one of the most significant days of the year for Russia and its national identity as it marks the anniversary of the then-Soviet Union’s defeat of Nazi Germany at the end of World War II in 1945.

The day sees Moscow display its military might with pomp, pride and pageantry, with massive military parades through the center of the capital, watched on by Putin and other senior Kremlin officials.

This year the event will have added significance given that Russia is actively engaged in a military conflict with Ukraine, having invaded its neighbor on Feb.24. 

Mass mobilization, or victory?
Western officials and geopolitical analysts, as well as Ukrainian intelligence, suggest that Putin could use this year’s Victory Day to announce a win in Ukraine — specifically in the eastern Donbas region where its forces have concentrated their attacks in recent weeks.

There are also fears the date could see Russia double-down on the invasion, ordering the mass mobilization of its army and citizens on a wartime footing.
Russia has certainly scaled up its attacks on Ukraine in recent days and, having pulled back its forces from the north in recent weeks, has focused on seizing key strategic positions in southern and eastern Ukraine, especially in the Donbas region where it has backed separatist rebels for the last eight years.

Looking ahead to Victory Day, William Alberque, director of strategy, technology and arms control at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said there are “two real big options” for Putin.

“One is he just declares victory with what he has and he says: ‘Look, I expanded the DPR and LPR [the two pro-Russian “People’s Republics” in Donetsk and Luhansk],’ and says: ‘I connected them to Crimea and the land bridge, and we secured the water supplies for Crimea and now I can declare that it’s part of Russia’,” Alberque said.

“Or, the alternative is that he declares actual war and a total war mobilization.”

Given the unpredictable nature of Putin’s leadership, Alberque said that “ultimately we have to prepare for the worst.”

The mass mobilization of Russia’s population for wartime operations would be a big step for Putin, however, potentially putting him at risk of popular dissent, particularly if thousands of new, young Russian conscripts are sent to fight in the war despite having little training.

In March, Putin signed a decree ordering 134,500 new conscripts into the army, raising eyebrows that they could destined to fight in Ukraine; Putin insisted they would not.
Russia has repeatedly denied that May 9 will herald the declaration of war on Ukraine and has shied away from the term “war” since its invasion began, instead calling it a “special military operation.”

Putin’s Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov this week rebuked journalists asking what the likelihood was of Putin declaring war on Ukraine, by telling them “no, this is nonsense.”

Russia is ‘preparing’
When asked whether Russia is planning to announce a full mobilization on May 9, Kyiv’s Defense Intelligence Chief Kyrylo Budanov appeared certain.

″Yes, they are preparing,” he said, adding that Rosreserv — Russia’s state agency responsible for storing, securing and managing reserves of food and state-owned equipment in preparation for states of emergency — had “started to check what they actually have in stock and to calculate what they can give out on mobilization orders.”

“This is an absolutely necessary step before the start of real mobilisation,” he added.
With ‘Victory Day’ focused on the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, the occasion would be ripe for Putin to liken its invasion of Ukraine, and what it claims is its “protection” of ethnic Russians there, to Russia’s defense of the country in World War II.

Britain’s Defense Minister Ben Wallace said last week that he would not be surprised if Putin would use Victory Day to declare Russia was “now at war with the world’s Nazis.” The Kremlin has repeatedly made baseless claims that Ukraine’s government is led by “Nazis” in a bid to justify its invasion to the Russian public, with experts saying there is no truth to the claim.

How far could Putin go?
There are concerns that any mass mobilization could be accompanied by the introduction of martial law in Russia, a move that would confer extraordinary powers on Putin, enabling a dramatic increase in his control over citizens’ lives and Russia’s economy.

Not only would it give him the power to close Russia’s borders and censor communications, but he could introduce curfews, control food supplies, seize private property and mobilize the population for wartime operations even to the point of forced labor for defense needs.

Russia’s constitution allows martial law to be introduced if the country is under attack from an external force and there are concerns Russia could prepare a “false flag” attack to justify all-out war, and martial law.

One of the big questions in this regards is how far Putin is willing to go to achieve his objectives in Ukraine.

Maximilian Hess, fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told CNBC that “it’s very clear that he wants to be able to have something that he considers a sizable victory and soon.”

Hess said the “complete eradication” of the Ukrainian army in Donetsk and Luhansk was Putin’s primary airm, but, “I don’t think that that’s where he wants to stop.”

“Whether there’s a clear Russian overarching military strategy remains to be seen, but the tactic is certainly a brutal one,” he added.
It’s widely believed that Russia is focusing its attacks on the Donbas region in order to fully claim the territory and to enable it to create a land bridge from Russia to Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, on the southern Ukrainian coast. This would give it access to ports crucial to its economy, and to its military fleet there on the Black Sea.

The battered coastal city of Mariupol — home to some of the most intense fighting over recent weeks — appears to is a key part of this plan, as its capture would help Russia secure the link between Crimea and the Donbas.

The U.K. Ministry of Defence on Friday noted that Russian forces have continued their assault on the Azovstal steel plant in the city for a second day, despite Russian statements claiming they would only seek to seal it off.

“The renewed effort by Russia to secure Azovstal and complete the capture of Mariupol is likely linked to the upcoming 9 May Victory Day commemorations and Putin’s desire to have a symbolic success in Ukraine,” the ministry tweeted.

Whether the capture of Mariupol and control of the Donbas region would satisfy Russia, and whether Ukraine is prepared to concede any of its territory (it says it is not), points to an open-ended conflict that could drag on for years. Strategists have warned that the conflict in Ukraine could become a war of attrition, with massive losses on both sides and no clear “victor.”

","Some evidence suggests that Moscow also sought to signal restraint. On May 9, Russia celebrated the
77th anniversary of the end of World War II with a Victory Day Parade in Moscow. On May 7, media
had reported that the Russian Defense Ministry had announced a fly-past maneuver with a Il-80 nuclear-command airplane.264 However, this component of the parade was cancelled “due to the
weather,” according to Kremlin spokesperson Peskov – although the weather in Moscow was sunny
and clear.
265 In in speech at the military parade, Putin drew parallels between World War II and Russia’s war in Ukraine, and again blamed the West, notably NATO, and the government in Kyiv for the
situation. The Alliance’s expansion had “forced” Russia to launch “a pre-emptive strike at the aggression.” Russian soldiers in Ukraine were “defending today what [their] fathers, grandfathers and greatgrandfathers fought for. The wellbeing and security of their Motherland was their top priority in life,”
said Putin.266 And yet, the Russian leader neither mentioned nuclear weapons nor announced a general mobilization, as some observers had expected him to do","The nuclear-capable component of the Victory Day parade is

2022-05-10,"Asked if Russia would rule out a preemptive tactical nuclear strike on Ukraine, Russia's deputy foreign minister said on Tuesday that a decision on the possible use of nuclear weapons was clearly set out in Russia's military doctrine, RIA reported.

""We have a military doctrine - everything is written there,"" Alexander Grushko was quoted by state news agency RIA as saying.

Russia's official military deployment principles allow for the use of nuclear weapons if they - or other types of weapons of mass destruction - are used against it, or if the Russian state faces an existential threat from conventional weapons.

The decision to use Russia's vast nuclear arsenal, the biggest in the world, rests with the Russian president, currently Vladimir Putin.

Russia's invasion has killed thousands of people, displaced nearly 10 million, and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States - by far the world's biggest nuclear powers.

U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns said on Saturday that Putin believes he cannot afford to lose in Ukraine and cautioned that the West could not ignore the risk of the use of tactical nuclear weapons by Moscow. read more

""We don't see, as an intelligence community, practical evidence at this point of Russian planning for a deployment or even use of tactical nuclear weapons,"" Burns said.

He cautioned, though, that ""the stakes are very high for Putin's Russia.""

NUCLEAR STRIKE?
A decree signed by Putin on June 2, 2020, said Russia views its nuclear weapons as ""exclusively a means of deterrence"".

It repeats the phraseology of the military doctrine but adds details about four circumstances under which a nuclear strike would be ordered. These include reliable information of a ballistic missile attack on Russia and an enemy's attack ""on critical state or military installations of the Russian Federation, the incapacitation of which would lead to the disruption of a response by nuclear forces.""

Putin, who has repeatedly expressed resentment over the way the West treated Russia after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, says Ukraine has been used by the United States to threaten Russia.

He justified his Feb. 24 order for a special military operation by saying Ukraine had persecuted Russian speakers and the United States was keen to enlarge the NATO military alliance in a way that would endanger Russia.

U.S. President Joe Biden casts Putin's invasion of Ukraine as a fight in a much broader global battle between democracy and autocracy. He has also called Putin a war criminal and has said the former KGB spy cannot remain in power.

Ukraine dismisses Russian claims that it persecuted Russian speakers and says it is fighting for its survival.

2022-05-10,"In Washington, US intelligence officials warned that the conflict would be prolonged and escalation remained possible. On May 10, Director of National Intelligence Haines provided another intelligence assessment of the ongoing war in a Testimony on Global Threats and National Security for the Senate Armed Services Committee. Putin was “preparing for prolonged conflict” during which he still intended to “achieve goals beyond the Donbas“ as he “most likely” also judged that Russia had “a greater ability and willingness to endure challenges than his adversaries.” Putin was “probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken,” Haines explained. In this context, she dampened hopes of a negotiated solution as long as both sides “believe they can continue to make progress militarily.” However, she warned, “Putin faces a mismatch between his ambitions and Russia’s current conventional military capabilities.” Therefore, “the next few months could see us moving along a more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory. At the very least, … the dichotomy will usher in a period of more ad hoc decision-making in Russia.” Current trends increase “the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means,” including “potentially escalatory military actions,” continued Haines. However, Haines interpreted Russia’s nuclear rhetoric as an attempt “to deter the United States and the West from increasing lethal aid to Ukraine and to respond to public comments of the US and NATO Allies that suggest expanded Western goals in the conflict. If Putin perceives the United States is ignoring his threats, he may try to signal to Washington the heightened danger of its support to Ukraine by authorizing another large nuclear exercise involving a major dispersal of mobile, intercontinental missiles, heavy bombers, strategic submarines,” she elaborated. But: Putin “would only authorize the use of nuclear weapons if he perceived an existential threat to the Russian state or regime,” she noted. “That could be the case in the event that he perceives that he is losing the war in Ukraine and that NATO, in effect, is either intervening or about to intervene.., which would obviously contribute to a perception that he is about to lose the war in Ukraine,” explained Haines. She also emphasized that “with tensions this high there’s always an enhanced potential for miscalculation, unintended escalation, which we hope our intelligence can help to mitigate","In Washington, US intelligence officials warned that the conflict would be prolonged and escalation
remained possible. On May 10, Director of National Intelligence Haines provided another intelligence assessment of the ongoing war in a Testimony on Global Threats and National Security for the
Senate Armed Services Committee. Putin was “preparing for prolonged conflict” during which he still
intended to “achieve goals beyond the Donbas“ as he “most likely” also judged that Russia had “a
greater ability and willingness to endure challenges than his adversaries.” Putin was “probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken,” Haines explained. In this context, she dampened hopes of a negotiated solution as long as both sides “believe they can continue to make progress militarily.” However, she warned, “Putin faces a mismatch between his ambitions and Russia’s current conventional
military capabilities.” Therefore, “the next few months could see us moving along a more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory. At the very least, … the dichotomy will usher in a period of
more ad hoc decision-making in Russia.” Current trends increase “the likelihood that President Putin
will turn to more drastic means,” including “potentially escalatory military actions,” continued
Haines.

2022-05-12,"One of President Vladimir Putin's closest allies warned the West on Thursday that the increasing military support given to Ukraine by the United States and its allies risked triggering a conflict between Russia and the NATO military alliance.

Former president Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, said such a conflict with NATO always carried the risk of turning into a full blown nuclear war.

Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, laid waste to swathes of its former Soviet neighbour and raised fears of the gravest confrontation between Russia and the United States since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

""NATO countries pumping weapons into Ukraine, training troops to use Western equipment, sending in mercenaries and the exercises of Alliance countries near our borders increase the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between NATO and Russia,"" Medvedev said in a Telegram post.

""Such a conflict always has the risk of turning into a full-fledged nuclear war,"" Medvedev said. ""This will be a disastrous scenario for everyone.""

Russia and the United States are by far the world's biggest nuclear powers: Russia has some 6,257 nuclear warheads while NATO's three nuclear powers - the United States, United Kingdom and France - have about 6,065 warheads combined, according to the Washington-based Arms Control Association.

Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people.

Putin, who says Ukraine and Russia are essentially one people, casts the war as an inevitable confrontation with the United States, which he accuses of threatening Russia by meddling in its backyard through NATO eastward enlargement.

Ukraine says it is fighting an imperial-style land grab and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. Kyiv says Putin's invasion has only strengthened the Ukrainian people's wish to turn westwards out of Russia's orbit.","From Moscow, Medvedev continued his “cautioning” stance on May 12. “NATO countries pumping
weapons into Ukraine, training troops to use Western equipment, sending in mercenaries and the exercises of Alliance countries near our borders increase the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between NATO and Russia,” he noted. “Such a conflict always has the risk of turning into a full-fledged
nuclear war,” Medvedev said. “This will be a disastrous scenario for everyone"," Medvedev: NATO aid to Ukraine could lead to an open conflict with
Russia, which would risk “full-fledged nuclear war.”

This was reported to TASS by a source in the military-industrial complex.

""The launch of Zircon to the maximum range has successfully completed the cycle of state tests of the missile from a surface carrier,"" he said.

TASS has no official information on this matter.

On May 28, the military department reported that the Project 22350 frigate ""Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Gorshkov"" fired a Zircon missile from the Barents Sea at a sea target in the White Sea at a range of about 1,000 km. According to objective control data, the missile successfully hit the sea target, the flight corresponded to the specified parameters.

Earlier, a TASS source reported that the Reutov NPO (part of the Tactical Missiles Corporation), which developed and produces the missile, is developing the latest coastal missile system under the hypersonic Zircon.

2022-05-29,"Russia's ambassador to Britain has told the BBC he does not believe his country will use tactical nuclear weapons in the war against Ukraine.

Andrei Kelin said that according to Russian military rules, such weapons are not used in conflicts like this.

He also described allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha as ""a fabrication"".

And he called UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss ""very belligerent"" and inexperienced.

On the use of nuclear weapons, Mr Kelin said Russia has very strict rules for their use, mainly when the state's existence is threatened.

""It has nothing to do with the current operation,"" he told BBC One's Sunday Morning.

When Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert in late February, soon after the invasion, it was widely perceived as a warning.

Mr Putin blamed the development on aggression by the West and Nato. But the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace branded it an attempt to distract people from ""what's going wrong in Ukraine"", saying Russia was behind schedule on its invasion after just a few days, and trying to ""remind the world"" it had a deterrent.

Tactical nuclear weapons are those which can be used at relatively short distances, as opposed to ""strategic"" nuclear weapons which can be launched over much longer distances and raise the spectre of all-out nuclear war.

But the term still includes many types of weapon, including smaller bombs and missiles used on a battlefield. Russia is thought to have about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons.

The BBC's Clive Myrie asked the ambassador about comments made by UK Foreign Minister Liz Truss, who said the war will only end once Russian President Vladimir Putin removes his troops entirely.

Mr Kelin said Ms Truss was ""very belligerent"".

He said she was ""neither a professional military man"" nor experienced as foreign secretary. ""If she would like to continue the war she will prolongate the conflict,"" he added.

In a sometimes terse exchange, the ambassador denied Russian forces were shelling civilians and said allegations of war crimes in the town of Bucha were a ""fabrication"".

Asked the question, ""Why is Russia conducting this war in this way, committing war crimes?"" Mr Kelin replied: ""The mayor of Bucha in his initial statement has confirmed that Russian troops has left, everything is clean and calm, the town in a normal state.

""Nothing is happening, no bodies are on the street. But next, after it has been done - but anyway...""

Myrie then pressed him: ""So this is all made up, Sir? This is all a fabrication? All this evidence is a fabrication?""

""In our view it is a fabrication. It is used just to interrupt negotiations,"" the ambassador replied.

Russia has made such allegations before, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov earlier claiming that footage of bodies in Bucha was ""staged"" after the Russians withdrew.

This was contradicted by numerous eyewitness accounts from residents, who told the BBC that Russian troops had summarily executed their loved ones.

""He was just a peaceful man, a family man, a welder, who struggled with a spine fracture and was disabled all his life,"" one man said of his murdered son-in-law.

Satellite imagery also appears to directly contradict Moscow's position, showing bodies lying in the street nearly two weeks before the Russians left the town.

Mr Kelin said the footage was ""probably a piece of a film or a piece of a game or a joke or whatever, it's a computer games set"".

What we heard from Russia's UK ambassador Andrei Kelin is what we've been hearing for years from Russian officials whenever their county is accused of anything.

All accusations are rebuffed, all evidence of Russian complicity is dismissed.

What you end up with is this parallel reality in which CCTV footage of Russian soldiers shooting dead unarmed Ukrainian civilians is dismissed as a joke or a computer game.

The horrors of Bucha are dismissed as a fabrication, and the levelling of residential areas of Mariupol is brushed aside as either collateral damage or blamed on Ukrainian soldiers.

In other words, none of this is ever Russia's fault, everyone is against Russia, everyone is blaming Russia, everyone is accusing Russia and it claims it is the innocent party.

This is the Kremlin narrative which we've heard many times before.

We heard it after the Salisbury poisonings, we heard it after the attempted assassination of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and we're hearing it again now.


","Yet, Russian mid-level officials continued to downplay Moscow’s nuclear narratives. On May 29, Russia’s ambassador to the United Kingdom Andrey Kelin confirmed that Russia would not use nuclear
weapons over Ukraine. According to Russian doctrine tactical nuclear weapons were “not used in
conflicts like [the one in Ukraine] at all,” he explained. As per its “very strict provisions,” tactical nuclear weapons would mainly be used “when the existence of the state is endangered.” This had “nothing to do with the current operation,” which remained a “limited conventional operation” as indicated
by Russia not increasing the number of its forces in Ukraine, he added.","Kelin: Russia will use nuclear weapons when state existence is

2022-06-02,"Congratulations to the Arms Control Association (ACA) on your 50th anniversary. 

Since 1972, the Arms Control Association has been a leader in the arms control community, providing insightful analysis and advocacy on nuclear weapons, arms control, and nonproliferation policy issues. The ACA built support in Congress for Cold War era arms control treaties, promoted cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union, and helped safeguard an international nuclear order that still benefits the American people today.

Throughout my career I have championed arms control efforts—grounded on our Nation's firm belief that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. That is why I acted immediately to extend the New START Treaty for five years when I took office as President. Negotiated during the Obama-Biden Administration, New START maintains verifiable limits on Russia's long-range nuclear arsenal—weapons that could be used directly against the American homeland—and has now been successfully implemented across three different Administrations. 

Our progress must continue beyond the New START extension. Even as we rally the world to hold Russia accountable for its brutal and unprovoked war on Ukraine, we must continue to engage Russia on issues of strategic stability. Today—perhaps more than any other time since the Cold War—we must work to reduce the risk of an arms race or nuclear escalation. My Administration is committed to reducing the existential threat posed by nuclear weapons, protecting the American people, and reinvigorating the global nuclear order to reduce the risk of use and proliferation of nuclear weapons. Achieving these global priorities requires U.S. leadership and energetic, capable, and resilient civil society partners, including organizations like the Arms Control Association. 

For 50 years, the Arms Control Association has educated citizens around the world to help create broad support for U.S.-led arms control and nonproliferation achievements. In this time of intense geopolitical tension, arms control and nonproliferation diplomacy continues to be an essential part of safeguarding American security and that of our allies as well as global stability. And we continue to count on the valuable contributions of the Arms Control Association. As you celebrate this milestone anniversary, may we recommit ourselves to upholding arms control and nonproliferation diplomacy for current and future generations in America and around the world.

2022-06-25,"Vladimir Putin: Alexander Grigoryevich, good afternoon!

Thanks for coming.

Our meeting today is taking place on a significant day - on the day of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between our countries. This is not an ordinary day, so we agreed to see you, and the volume of our interaction is such that it requires constant checking of clocks, which is what we are doing.

I would like to note once again that last year the trade turnover increased by more than a third, amounting to more than $38 billion, and this increase continues in the first four months of this year.

A. Lukashenko : 110 percent.

Vladimir Putin: Well, so, apparently, we are on the right track.

Russia has invested four billion dollars in the economy of Belarus in previous years - these are our direct investments. There are also investments from Belarusian enterprises. We have good big joint projects, and there are a lot of current issues in this area.

I would like to inform you about the progress and results of the discussion with colleagues within the framework of the BRICS association. Many of the speakers expressed concerns about disruptions in food supplies, rising global food prices and fertilizers.

Bearing in mind that Russia and Belarus are the largest suppliers of fertilizers to the world market, I would like to talk to you about this as well, in terms of meeting the needs of the world market and our regular customers.

We have, I think, 15 percent of world trade and 25 percent for some types of fertilizers – this is a very significant volume on world markets. The lack of fertilizer, of course, reduces the prospects for next year's harvest. All this is very sad.

Nevertheless, you and I agreed to do everything that depends on us, to take all the actions that depend on us in order – I repeat once again – to meet the demands of our consumers, our clients.

There are, of course, problems associated with ensuring security in the region and in the world as a whole. There are many questions here. I will brief you on all these issues in relation to the events in the Donbass.

And of course, issues related to the construction of the Union State remain in our field of vision. Here we have practically everything agreed between the relevant departments, the only question is the implementation of all the goals set.

In general, we have a rather large, voluminous list of issues that we must discuss today.

A. Lukashenko: Vladimir Vladimirovich, I always thank you for the fact that as a historian, you know, I managed to discover some things for myself. You allowed me to touch this wonderful place, I visited Bronka, where we plan to build a Belarusian port. Thank you for your support, you approved that construction project.

I looked, I was very pleased to see what Kronstadt is, to face face to face, the dam, the construction of which was completed with your great assistance, in your period. Well, look at other places, in general, see from the water what Peter is. For me it was very important and useful from the point of view of building a port economy.

We are satisfied with the place that is designated and supported by you, the place is good. Therefore, we are already slowly starting to ship mineral fertilizers there. I think that there will be the most powerful port. We may not even have enough. But, as we agreed, we will see if we need to expand.

I planned to discuss economic issues with you today - you touched on them. I would ask you to talk in more detail about defense issues: this is very important for us now, critically important in connection with what is happening in the West, as well as security issues.

If we talk about the economy, our traditional topic is import substitution. We have proposed 15 major projects. The Russian side approved them, you supported us in terms of co-financing these projects. If everything goes as planned, we will soon start producing import-substituting products. That is, those companies of unfriendly countries that supplied us, to Russia and Belarus, products, we will be able to produce our own during this and next year. There are 15 such large projects.

Logistics: I have already mentioned the port of Bronka, I looked at it today.

I want to talk to you about the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, where we are observers. Perhaps we will consult, you will support, increase, expand our status. A lot of time has already passed. I think we will not be superfluous there.

Let's discuss the problem of the Forum of Regions.

Vladimir Putin: July 1.

Alexander Lukashenko: Yes, I think that we will take part in it, as usual, by videoconference. This forum is held by parliamentarians, the upper houses of parliaments. Here and in Russia, they are well organized and will hold a very good forum in Grodno.

I have a number of private questions that I want to discuss with you: in the field of the economy, as well as questions relating to defense.

Vladimir Vladimirovich, we are very annoyed by the situation and the policy pursued by our neighbors. You, in general, know that this is the leadership of Poland and the leadership of Lithuania. The policy of confrontation. And you have enough of them, especially in Ukraine: recently, most of the mercenaries, as we notice, are from Poland. I don’t understand why they need it, confrontation, but it’s clear that they are standing behind their backs, pushing and so on. But the policy is disgusting, the behavior is aggressive.

The same is true for Lithuania. Recently, there has been a growing flow of information about their plan to stop transit from Russia through Belarus to Kaliningrad, to isolate Kaliningrad. Listen, this is akin to declaring some kind of war already, such things are unacceptable in modern conditions.

We are very concerned about the issues of training flights of aircraft of the United States of America and NATO, which are trained to carry nuclear warheads and nuclear charges. It makes us very stressed.

Therefore, I ask you to consider the question of a mirror answer to these things, without busting. They are training to carry nuclear warheads, can you at least help us to adapt our aircraft that we have, Su-35, I think, that can carry nuclear warheads. I’m not talking about what we will transport tomorrow or you will transport nuclear weapons there, but we can’t joke, we remember 1941, when we were lulled to sleep: everything will be fine, everything is quiet, no one will attack - and then we were not ready for this . Therefore, this is a very serious situation for us, and this is not the first time I have put this question before you. I know what you considered in the Ministry of Defense.

I would like to hear how things develop here. I make no secret, I am raising the question that we should be ready for anything, even for the use of the most serious weapons, in order to defend our Fatherland from Brest to Vladivostok. This is our immediate responsibility. And especially these trainings, you also know about them, American flights using NATO partners. If they train, then they probably think something, or why train?

In general, we must discuss a range of defense and security issues with you today so that our people understand that they, Russians and Belarusians, are under serious protection.

Vladimir Putin: Alexander Grigorievich, we will now discuss the entire range of issues related to the development of infrastructure, trade, and the implementation of major projects.

By the way, this morning I discussed with the leadership of the Government within the framework of credit resources, which we talked about, in order to create financial opportunities for Belarusian enterprises and start producing import-substituting products - not only import-substituting, but also creating our own engineering studies, for in order to reach a higher level of what we, Russia and Belarus, need. The government agrees that part of these resources should be and can be used by Belarusian enterprises in order to be able to produce products for third-country markets as well. Ultimately, Russia will also be interested in this, bearing in mind the level of our cooperation.

As for security issues, yes, indeed, in Europe, the Americans have 200 nuclear tactical ammunition, mostly atomic bombs, 200 in six European countries - members of the North Atlantic bloc of NATO. For their possible use, 257 aircraft have been prepared - and not only American, but also these countries I have mentioned.

A. Lukashenko: Outside the US.

Vladimir Putin: Outside the US, in Europe.

A. Lukashenko: There is not a single base like this in Russia.

Vladimir Putin: Not in Russia.

You said that it would be possible to answer mirrored. It is possible, but you and I, even a mirror image, probably should not answer, there is no need.

But I completely agree with you that we are obliged to take care of the unconditional provision of our security, the security of the Union State, and perhaps other CSTO countries.

Therefore, I propose the following: the Belarusian army is armed with a fairly large group of Su-25 aircraft, they could be re-equipped accordingly.

A. Lukashenko: 25 planes?

Vladimir Putin: Yes, Su-25. They could be upgraded. True, this modernization should be carried out at aircraft factories in Russia, but we will agree with you on how to do this. And accordingly, start training the flight crew. This is the first.

And second. As you and I agreed, you raised the issue, we have made a decision: within the next few months we will transfer to Belarus the Iskander-M tactical missile systems, which, as you know, can use both ballistic and cruise missiles , both in conventional and nuclear versions.

I propose that the ministries of defense and the chiefs of the general staff should be instructed to work out all the details related to this joint work.

A. Lukashenko: Yes, I absolutely agree.

Vladimir Putin: Agreed.

As for economic issues, I would still propose to return to the topic that is now the most relevant - the food topic and the topic of supplying fertilizers to world markets.

We are in close contact with the relevant relevant UN agencies. I would also like to inform you how this work is developing.

A. Lukashenko: But we have no problems with deliveries of either grain or fertilizers to the market. You don't have to put it on us.

Vladimir Putin: This is true. This is what I wanted to talk about, because many of our partners are asking for more deliveries. We just need to talk about the details related to logistics.

And last year Russia supplied more than 40 million tons of grain to world markets. This agricultural year - until next summer - we will be ready to deliver, probably, more than 50 million tons. I know that Belarus is also increasing production, and under your leadership, Belarusian agriculture is developing very confidently and successfully.

As for fertilizers, here we need, of course, to join forces in order to help our traditional partners get the necessary…

A. Lukashenko: We produce half of the fertilizers together with Russia, half! These are huge volumes.

Vladimir Putin: Production of some [species] is somewhere around 15 percent, and 25 percent in trade.

<…>","In the same vein, on June 25 at a meeting with Belarusian President Lukashenko in St. Petersburg,
Putin announced the transfer of nuclear-capable Iskander-M missiles to Belarus, as well as the reequipment of Belarusian SU-35 planes to carry nuclear weapons. The move was depicted as a reaction to Lithuania’s alleged plan “to stop transit from Russia to Kaliningrad” and to US and NATO exercises with nuclear capable aircraft. Lukashenko noted that Lithuania’s “plan to stop transit from Russia through Belarus to Kaliningrad” was “akin to declaring some kind of war.” When asking for
adapting Belarusian aircraft for nuclear use, he was not “talking about what we will transport tomorrow or whether they will transport nuclear weapons,” but he remembered “1941, when we were
lulled to sleep,” Lukashenko said. Putin answered that Russia was “obliged” to take care of the security of Belarus, and proposed that “the Belarusian army is armed with a fairly large group of Su-25
aircraft, they could be re-equipped accordingly.” Hence, “within the next few months we will transfer
to Belarus the Iskander-M tactical missile systems, which, as you know, can use both ballistic and
cruise missiles, both in conventional and nuclear versions.”","Putin: Announces the transfer of nuclear-capable missiles to Belarus and the re-equipment of its bombers to carry nuclear weapons.

2022-06-27,"We, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), are steadfast in our solidarity with Ukraine,
and reaffirm our unwavering commitment to support the government and people of
Ukraine in their courageous defence of their country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,
and in their fight for a peaceful, prosperous and democratic future. We welcome the
European Council’s decision to grant the status of candidate country to Ukraine and
Moldova. We will continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic
support and stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. As we do so, we commit to
demonstrate global responsibility and solidarity through working to address the
international impacts of Russia’s aggression, especially on the most vulnerable.
Condemnation of Russia’s war: We remain appalled by and continue to condemn the
brutal, unprovoked, unjustifiable and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine by Russia
and aided by Belarus. We condemn and will not recognise Russia’s continued attempts to
re-draw borders by force. This devastating war has produced dramatic consequences far
beyond Europe. It constitutes a blatant violation of international law, in particular a grave
breach of the United Nations Charter. It seriously undermines the international rules-based
system that underpins global peace, prosperity, and security. We further condemn Russian
attempts to replace Ukrainian democratically elected officials with illegitimate ones. We
reiterate our demand that Russia put an end to this war of choice, and immediately,
unconditionally cease all hostilities and withdraw its troops and military equipment from
the entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders. We reiterate
our condemnation of Russia's unjustified use of nuclear rhetoric and signaling. Russia must
abide by its international commitments, including those which ban the use of chemical,
biological or nuclear weapons. We urge Russia to behave responsibly and exercise restraint,
and reiterate that any use of such weapons would be unacceptable and met with severe
consequences. In this regard we express serious concern after the announcement by Russia
that it could transfer missiles with nuclear capabilities to Belarus.
Supporting Ukrainian Efforts to End the War: We are committed to helping Ukraine to
uphold its sovereignty and territorial integrity, to defend itself, and to choose its own
future. It is up to Ukraine to decide on a future peace settlement, free from external
pressure or influence. We will continue to coordinate efforts to meet Ukraine’s urgent
requirements for military and defence equipment. We will also continue to coordinate to 
provide Ukraine with the material, training and logistic, intelligence, and economic support
to build up its armed forces.
Commitment to Ukraine’s Security and Resilience: With a view to a viable post-war peace
settlement, we are ready to reach arrangements together with interested countries and
institutions and Ukraine on sustained security commitments to help Ukraine defend itself,
secure its free and democratic future, and deter future Russian aggression. We stand ready
to further strengthen Ukraine’s resilience by expanding our cooperation in intelligence and
information sharing, information security, as well as maritime security. We will continue
supporting Ukraine in defending its networks against cyber incidents and expand our
cooperation in the fields of energy security, the safety and security of nuclear material and
facilities, environmental, and water use issues. We will continue to support Ukraine in
resisting threats to its democratic institutions and their common democratic values and
principles, including through support for free media as well as countering disinformation
and interference in democratic processes.
Humanitarian Assistance: Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and the
indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, have caused immeasurable
human suffering and loss of life. As a consequence, we witness today the largest
displacement of civilians in Europe since the Second World War. As G7, we have provided
and pledged more than USD 2.8 billion in humanitarian assistance so far in 2022. We
underline our shared commitment to continue to provide substantial and ongoing
humanitarian support to those affected by Russia’s war, in particular to protect the rights
of women and children.
Supporting Internally Displaced Persons and Refugees: We reaffirm our resolve to protect
and support forcibly displaced persons and refugees, and, to provide relief to host
countries. We applaud the solidarity and efforts of all countries that support Ukraine by
hosting refugees fleeing combat zones. We will enhance our support through the provision
of short- and medium-term assistance, as well as strengthening access to a range of
support services for those displaced and affected both in Ukraine as well as in other host
countries. To this end, we endorse the Moldova Support Platform. We will seek to provide
safe passage for refugees, including by further streamlining immigration procedures and
visa requirements and strengthening efforts to prevent and respond to the heightened risk
of human trafficking among the refugee population, who are disproportionately women
and children. We aim to further facilitate the integration of refugees from Ukraine into our
labour markets, to protect and ensure their labour rights, and to provide access to adequate
social protection and education for as long as necessary.
Compliance with International Humanitarian Law: We call on Russia to comply with its
obligations under international humanitarian law. We urge Russia to immediately provide 
for safe, rapid, and unimpeded humanitarian access and make safe passages work, enabling
humanitarian aid to be delivered to besieged cities and civilians to reach safety towards a
destination of their choice. Furthermore, we demand that Russia immediately allow the
safe return of Ukrainian nationals taken often with force to Russia without their consent.
We also underline the need to ensure protection for neutral and impartial humanitarian
organisations and their aid workers operating in Ukraine. Russia and its proxies must
respect international humanitarian law, including the rights and protections afforded to
prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions. We condemn the sham “trials” resulting
in application of the death sentence to members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
Accountability for War Crimes: There can be no impunity for war crimes and other
atrocities. We condemn in the strongest terms ongoing attacks on civilians and noncombatants, the systematic targeting of critical infrastructure, schools and kindergartens,
healthcare personnel and facilities, as well as conflict-related sexual and gender-based
violence in Ukraine. We further condemn the deliberate targeting of Ukrainian cultural sites
and regard the destruction of Ukrainian heritage by Russian forces – and suppression of
the Ukrainian language and media in areas illegally occupied by Russia – as an attempt to
wipe out Ukraine’s history and cultural identity. We welcome and support the ongoing
work to investigate war crimes and other atrocity crimes, including by the Prosecutor of
the International Criminal Court (ICC), the independent international commission of
inquiry mandated by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and the work of
the Expert Missions under the Moscow Mechanism of the Organization for Security and
Co-operation in Europe’s (OSCE) as well as the national investigations by the Office of the
Prosecutor General of Ukraine. We welcome efforts to increase cooperation between all
investigations taking place in Ukraine and will intensify our police and judicial cooperation
with Ukraine as well as with relevant organisations. We welcome national investigative and
jurisdiction efforts in line with the principle of universal jurisdiction where consistent with
domestic law. The immediate perpetrators of war crimes and other atrocity crimes, as well
as officials and military leaders responsible for their commission, must be held to account
in accordance with international law.
Safe Haven for Dissidents Fleeing Russia’s Political Repression: We are concerned by the
fact that Russia's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine is accompanied by ever stronger
internal repression within Russia, especially against independent journalists, human rights
activists and opposition figures, as well as ordinary citizens. We will make available
protection to Russians who are persecuted by the Russian regime, as consistent with our
national laws and requirements.
Increasing Food Security: Russia bears enormous responsibility for rising threats to global
food security as a result of the conflict. Russia’s unprovoked assault on Ukraine – marked
by bombing, blockades, and theft – has severely prevented Ukraine from exporting its
agricultural products and is hampering its production capacity, leading to steep price rises
and increasing global food insecurity for millions, especially those most vulnerable, such as
women and children. We urgently call on Russia to cease, without condition, its attacks on
agricultural and transport infrastructure and enable free passage of agricultural shipping
from Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea. We are united and determined to strongly support
Ukraine in producing and exporting grain, oil, and other agricultural products and we will
foster coordinated initiatives that promote global food security and address the causes of
the evolving a global food crisis.
Sanctions: We remain steadfast in our commitment to our unprecedented coordinated
sanctions measures in response to Russia’s war of aggression, the impacts of which will
compound over time. We are committed to sustaining and intensifying international
economic and political pressure on President Putin’s regime and its enablers in Belarus,
depriving Russia of the economic means to persist in its war of aggression against Ukraine,
and we will continue our targeted use of coordinated sanctions for as long as necessary,
acting in unison at every stage. Our use of sanctions is in defence of the rules-based
international order that Russia has so egregiously violated. To this end, we endorse the
annex on Supporting Ukraine Through Responsible Sanctions Against Russia.
In order to further intensify our economic measures against Russia, we collectively commit
to taking the following measures in the days and weeks ahead, consistent with our
respective legal authorities and processes. We will continue to explore new ways to isolate
Russia from participating in the global market and crack down on evasion. We are
determined to reduce Russia’s revenues, including from gold. We will also continue to
target evasion and backfilling activities. We will further reduce Russia’s export revenues by
taking appropriate steps to further reduce dependency on Russian energy, as articulated in
the Energy section of our Communique. We will continue to coordinate on tariff measures
on imports from Russia and explore possible pathways in line with our respective legislation
to use the revenues to assist Ukraine where applicable. We will align and expand targeted
sanctions to further restrict Russia’s access to key industrial inputs, services, and
technologies produced by our economies, particularly those supporting Russia’s armament
industrial base and technology sector. Finally, we will increase the costs of Russia’s war on
Ukraine by imposing targeted sanctions on those responsible for war crimes, exercising
illegitimate authority in Ukraine, and those standing behind Russia’s engagement in efforts
to increase global food insecurity by stealing and exporting Ukrainian grain or otherwise
profit illegitimately from the war.
As we impose severe costs on Russia and those who are complicit in its aggression, we will
continue to assist the global economy and take action to help mitigate spillover effects,
especially relating to humanitarian and other basic needs, and vulnerable populations. We
will continue to ensure that in taking further measures, we are not targeting food and allow 
for the free flow of agricultural products and make every effort to minimise potential
negative impacts and spillovers on third countries, in particular low- and middle-income
countries. We are united in our commitment to fully implement and enforce these
measures and remain vigilant against sanctions evasion and backfilling. Recalling the
resolutions of the UN General Assembly on 2nd and 24th March 2022, we call on all
countries around the world to stand with us in defending the principles of the UN Charter,
and to join us by taking similar actions.
Financial and Economic Support: As of today we are ready to grant, or have pledged and
provided up to USD 29.5 billion of budget support in 2022 to help Ukraine close its
financing gap and continue ensuring the delivery of basic services to the Ukrainian people.
Overall, this support is urgently needed and comes on top of the economic support
provided since 2014 until 2021, which exceeds USD 60 billion. We welcome and support
ongoing work across international financial institutions (IFIs) on further substantial
financing to Ukraine, notably the financial support from the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, including the Bank’s multi-donor financing vehicles for
Ukraine and the establishment of the Fund’s Multi-Donor Administered Account for
Ukraine. We look forward to additional planned support to Ukrainian state-owned
enterprises and the private sector through the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) and the International Finance Corporation which amounts to USD
3.5 billion. We will support the EBRD, including through providing specific support to
critical infrastructure, notably to guarantee EBRD loans to gas, power, and transportation
companies. Across all our support, we are urgently working on accelerating disbursements
of our financial commitments to Ukraine. Furthermore, we commit to assisting Ukraine in
maximising its export potential. We task Finance Ministers to continue to work with IFIs
and with Ukraine to assess and address its financing needs. We task G7 Trade Ministers to
discuss concrete proposals to support Ukraine’s recovery efforts through trade, including
for example suspending tariffs on Ukrainian exports.
Reconstruction: We recognise the devastating destruction of infrastructure, including
basic social and public infrastructure, cities, industry, and agricultural facilities in Ukraine,
and the urgent need for immediate reconstruction of critical infrastructure. We stand ready
to support an international reconstruction plan, drawn up and implemented by Ukraine in
close coordination with bilateral and multilateral partners and organisations in support of
a sustainable, resilient, inclusive, and green economic recovery which enhances strong
democratic institutions, rule of law, and anti-corruption measures. To this end, we
welcome the Presidency’s initiative to convene with Ukraine an international high-level
experts conference, to make progress on a comprehensive reconstruction plan. We support
the World Bank Group’s support package to Ukraine and the EBRD’s Resilience Package,
as well as ongoing work by the European Union and its Member States, considering a 
Ukraine reconstruction platform and a solidarity fund. Communities, civil society
organisations, including women’s rights organisations, and the private sector should be
active participants in planning Ukraine’s future. The recovery and reconstruction plan
should build local resilience and social cohesion by ensuring that all members of society,
particularly those most affected by the war, equally benefit. We are strongly committed to
supporting Ukrainian reconstruction and will step up our respective efforts. We will also
explore other viable options to support Ukraine’s humanitarian needs, early recovery, and
reconstruction, including using frozen Russian assets consistent with our national laws. We
call on all partners to join our efforts, and engage with us to help Ukraine to rebuild its
future. ","The G7 states immediately responded to Moscow’s decision. On June 26-28, G7 leaders and representatives of the European Union met for a Summit in Germany.368 During a virtual address at the

2022-06-28,"AU.S. hypersonic missile test failed because of the complexities of the rocket's design, according to a Russian defense analyst, who said that perfecting the project might take some time.

On Thursday, the Pentagon announced the failure of the Common Hypersonic Glide Body (CHGB) test amid concerns that the U.S. is falling behind Russia and China in developing the weapons whose speed and maneuverability make them hard to defend against.

The test at Hawaii's Pacific Missile Range Facility was supposed to launch the weapon system on top of a two-stage missile booster, which would accelerate it to more than five times the speed of sound (Mach 5). Then the glide body would detach and use its speed to reach the target.

Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Tim Gorman said ""an anomaly occurred following ignition of the test asset"" without further specifying the nature of the anomaly or what stage of the test it had occurred.

""Program officials have initiated a review to determine the cause to inform future tests,"" he said in a statement, ""the information gathered from this event will provide vital insights.""

But Russian defense analyst Alexei Ramm told the Kremlin-friendly newspaper Izvestia his view about what happened, describing how the test had been hit by a ""second-stage failure.""

""Of course, a failed test will not stop the project. At the same time, it is already clear that it is unlikely that American engineers will be able to quickly solve the problem,"" he said.

Ramm told the newspaper that the presence of a second stage showed that the design of the rocket is too complex with high-tech elements that needed to be integrated. The newspaper said that this is a long process requiring much testing and launches.

""Russian hypersonic weapons developers do not try to create such overly complex missile systems. In particular, the Tsirkon flies quite successfully even without a second stage,"" Ramm told the paper.

A Tsirkon missile system is slated to enter service with the Russian Navy by the end of the year, Russian agencies reported last month.

Unlike pure hypersonic missiles which rely on an advanced propulsion system known as a scramjet, the Tsirkon is thought to use existing technology and has been described as a ""hybrid cruise missile and ballistic missile.""

It is thought to use a solid fuel booster to take the missile from launch to high altitude before it follows a semi-ballistic ""skip-glide"" trajectory towards its target. Experts have warned that it could overwhelm the American Aegis Combat System.

The failure of the U.S. missile test was the latest setback for the U.S. to develop hypersonic weapons. It was the second unsuccessful test flight of the prototype weapon known as Conventional Prompt Strike.

In the first flight test in October 2021, there was a booster failure, which prevented the missile from leaving the launch pad. The weapon is intended for Zumwalt destroyers and Virginia-class submarines, Bloomberg reported.

As the war rages in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has repeatedly boasted about his country's hypersonic weapons prowess.

There is a growing fight for supremacy in the Black Sea, where such weapons could be used and where Ukrainian troops recaptured the strategically important Snake Island from Russia.

When contacted for comment, the Pentagon shared Gorman's media statement with Newsweek, which also said ""experiments and tests, both successful and unsuccessful, are the backbone of developing highly complex, critical technologies at tremendous speed.""

""Delivering hypersonic weapons remains a top priority and the Department remains confident that it is on track to field offensive and defensive hypersonic capabilities on target dates beginning in the early 2020s.""","Meanwhile, the US military seemed bent to return to its normal testing pattern for new missiles. On
June 28, it conducted an unsuccessful hypersonic missile flight test. Nevertheless, “the information
gathered from this event will provide vital insights,” stressed Pentagon spokesperson Tim Gorman.

2022-07-06,"Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told the United States on Wednesday that attempts by the West to punish a nuclear power such as Russia for the war in Ukraine risked endangering humanity.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has triggered the most serious crisis in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when many people feared the world was on the brink of nuclear war.

Medvedev cast the United States as an empire which had spilled blood across the world, citing the killing of Native Americans, U.S. nuclear attacks on Japan and a host of wars ranging from Vietnam to Afghanistan.

Attempts to use courts or tribunals to investigate Russia's actions in Ukraine would, Medvedev said, be futile and risk global devastation.

""The idea of punishing a country that has one of the largest nuclear potentials is absurd. And potentially poses a threat to the existence of humanity,"" Medvedev, who now serves as deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, said on Telegram.

Russia and the United States control about 90% of the world's nuclear warheads, with around 4,000 warheads each in their military stockpiles, according to the Federation of American Scientists.

While president from 2008 to 2012, Medvedev presented himself as a reformer who wanted better relations with the West.

But since President Vladimir Putin ordered the Feb. 24 invasion,

he has recast himself as a vociferous Kremlin hardliner.

""The whole of American history, starting with the conquest of the Native Indians, is a bloody war of annihilation,"" he said.

U.S. President Joe Biden says Putin is a war criminal who launched an illegal invasion of Ukraine. The United States is supplying arms to Ukraine which says it is fighting for its survival.

Russia says what it calls ""a special military operation"" is intended to degrade the Ukrainian military and root out people it calls dangerous nationalists. Putin says the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia.

Medvedev said the United States had killed millions of people across the world since World War Two.
","Against this background, Medvedev once again alluded to Russia’s nuclear capability. Referring to
calls “to create tribunals or courts for a so-called investigation of Russia’s actions,” he suggested on
July 6 that “the idea of punishing a country that has one of the largest nuclear potential is absurd. And
potentially poses a threat to the existence of humanity.","Medvedev: Trying to punish a country with a large nuclear arsenal is

2022-07-07,"Russia considers talks about the possibility of a nuclear war unacceptable, the speaker of the Russian Federation Council said Thursday.

""It is unacceptable to even talk about the possibility of a nuclear war at all. Any sane person, especially a politician and statesman, understands that a nuclear war, if God forbid it happened, generally means the end of human civilization,” Valentina Matvienko said at a news conference in Moscow when asked if the current Russian-Western confrontation regarding the war in Ukraine may evolve into a nuclear conflict. “It can't even be discussed. It is impossible to imagine this even in the most terrible nightmare.”

Russia perceives nuclear weapons as a tool of containment. Its military doctrine allows only the defensive use of this kind of weapon, in response to an attack, she said.

Regarding comments by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who announced his desire to turn Ukraine into a nuclear power, Matvienko said: ""It's like giving a grenade to a madman.""

She slammed the idea of transferring Russia's assets frozen in the West to Ukraine as state-sponsored theft.

""This is some kind of state banditry. When all international rules are violated, when absolutely illegal sanctions are imposed, assets of a sovereign state are frozen and plundered on an ethnic basis, the property of Russian citizens is liquidated and taken away without trial, investigation and specific claims,” she said, ""State banditry is that they consider it possible to interfere in the affairs of sovereign states -- Yugoslavia, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and so on.”

All illegal actions are taken to preserve the US’ hegemony, she said.

Matvienko refused to speculate about the fate of Ukraine's territory that went under Russia's control, noting that residents of those territories will decide what to do.

""If residents of Donetsk and Lugansk, other territories and regions of Ukraine consider it necessary to hold a referendum (on joining the Russian Federation), to express their will, we, within the framework of our constitutional duties, powers, of course, will consider this issue,"" she said.

Johnson discredited himself as a politician

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson disgraced himself as a politician but continues to cling to the position, Matvienko said in response to a question about the political crisis in Great Britain.

""He discredited himself in the eyes of his own citizens as a prime minister. As a politician, in my opinion, he deserves an adequate assessment.

""At the current level of distrust on the part of UK residents, Johnson has to resign as prime minister of the country, although he clings (to his position) to the last,"" she said.

Johnson pursued a hostile policy toward Russia and he was doing it without taking into account the opinions of UK citizens, she added.

""As a result of such a thoughtless policy and disregard for our own national interests, we see what the situation has come to in many European countries. According to the latest data, 70% of UK residents do not support the policy of Prime Minister Johnson,"" she said.

Johnson agreed to resign Thursday after coming under enormous pressure as more than 50 politicians have resigned from his government in the last 48 hours.

Johnson will resign as Conservative leader but it is not clear whether he will continue to serve as prime minister until the party elects a new leader.","However, another Russian official again played down Moscow’s nuclear narratives. On July 7, Valentina Matvienko, speaker of the Russian Federation Council, stated that it was “unacceptable to even
talk about the possibility of a nuclear war at all.” “Any sane person, especially a politician and statesman, understands that a nuclear war, if God forbid it happened, generally means the end of human
civilization,” she added. “Russia views nuclear weapons only as a deterrent,” Matvienko explained.
“We have clearly and strictly prescribed those exceptional cases when it can be used only in response
to (God forbid that this never happens) a nuclear attack.” Also: “We behave like a civilized country,
and we do it openly, we declare this publicly and strictly follow our obligations, and we are doing everything to ensure that nothing like this happen,” she stressed.

2022-08-02,"Ladies and gentlemen!

I welcome you on the occasion of the opening of the 10th Anniversary Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

Over more than half a century of its existence, the Treaty has become one of the key elements of the international system of security and strategic stability. The obligations envisaged by it in the areas of non-proliferation, disarmament and the peaceful use of atomic energy fully meet the interests of both nuclear and non-nuclear countries.

As a state party to the NPT and one of its depositaries, Russia consistently follows the letter and spirit of the Treaty. Our obligations under bilateral agreements with the United States on the reduction and limitation of relevant weapons have also been fully fulfilled. We proceed from the premise that there can be no winners in a nuclear war and it must never be unleashed, and we stand for equal and indivisible security for all members of the world community.

We attach great importance to the IAEA safeguards system as a verification mechanism of the Treaty and consider it extremely important to ensure its objective, depoliticized and technically justified application.

We are convinced that all countries that comply with the requirements of the NPT should have the right to access peaceful nuclear energy without any additional conditions. We are ready to share our experience in the field of nuclear energy with our partners.

We hope that the Conference will reaffirm the readiness of all states parties to the NPT to strictly adhere to their obligations and will make a significant contribution to strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime, to ensuring peace, security and stability on the planet.

I wish you successful work and all the best.

Vladimir Putin","Meanwhile, Russian representatives rejected these accusations. Moscow “consistently follows” the
NPT’s “letter and spirit,” starting “from the premise that there can be no winners in a nuclear war and
it must never be unleashed,” Putin declared on August 1.
445
In its prepared statement from August 2, Russia argued that the fact that “the international security
and strategic stability situation has been deteriorating rapidly” was not its fault. Moscow had been
and remained committed to “freeing the world from the threat posed by WMDs.” Russia had been
committed to security and stability, but these “positive achievements” had been “devalued” by the “US
policy of ignoring Russia’s red lines in the field of security.” Nuclear powers had to “behave with restraint and responsibility” and Moscow was “strongly convinced that a nuclear war cannot be won
and must never be fought.” Hence, it would not deploy INF systems where the United States refrained
from doing so. Also, it had “significantly reduced the role of nuclear weapons in its defense policy,
which is purely defensive in nature and is aimed at protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.” Regarding Ukraine, Russia wanted to “strongly reject all allegations.” The Ukrainian
“regime” had come to power “as a result of a coup” and persecuted the Russian-speaking population.
For eight years, “Ukrainian nationalists were killing civilians on this territory with near impunity and
preparing a large-scale military invasion of the republics that, in fact, broke away from Ukraine.”446
Subsequently, the Russian delegation also took the floor in a right of reply to talk about the nuclear
dimension of the Ukraine crisis. First, Moscow stated that it was fulfilling its obligations with the Budapest Memorandum, including “a commitment not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons.” This
was “fully implemented with respect to Ukraine, including in recent months.” Second, the Russian delegation underlined the defensive nature of Russia’s nuclear doctrine. A nuclear reaction would occur
“solely as a response to aggression involving weapons of mass destruction” or when a conventional
attack threatened “the very existence of the state.” But: “None of these two hypothetical scenarios is
relevant to the situation in Ukraine.” Third, the Russians noted that their warning was related to a
conflict with NATO potentially leading to nuclear exchanges. “Any military confrontation between nuclear rivals must be prevented, since it is fraught with the risk of escalation to the nuclear level,” the
argument went. A NATO intervention in Ukraine “would be able to trigger one of the two emergency
scenarios described in our doctrine. We obviously stand for preventing this, but if Western countries
try to test our resolve, Russia will not back down. And this is not the language of threats at all, but a
statement of what is possible – such is the logic of deterrence.”447
Media reports from August 2 noted that Russian diplomat Alexander Trofimov rejected “utterly unfounded, detached from reality and unacceptable speculations that Russia allegedly threatens to use
nuclear weapons, particularly in Ukraine.” However, Moscow could decide to use its nuclear arsenal
in response to “direct aggression” by NATO countries. Yet, Russia would only use nuclear weapons in
response to weapons of mass destruction or a conventional weapons attack that threatened the existence of the Russian state. “None of these two hypothetical scenarios is relevant to the situation in
Ukraine,” the Russian delegate said. However, he accused NATO countries of a “fierce hybrid confrontation” against Russia that now “dangerously balances on the edge of open military clash.” Such a
clash would “be able to trigger one of the two emergency scenarios described in our doctrine,” Trofimov said. “We obviously stand for preventing this, but if Western countries try to test our resolve,
Russia will not back down.”","Restatement of official nuclear doctrine and claim that none
of its contingencies is “relevant to the situation in Ukraine.”

2022-08-05,"Mr. Chairman,
First of all, we would like to draw attention to the working paper of the
Russian Federation entitled ""Nuclear disarmament: an area of shared
responsibility"" containing views on a number of aspects of nuclear disarmament
issues, which is available on the websites of the Review Conference
(NPT/CONF.2020/WP.56).
Mr. Chairman,
Nuclear disarmament is at the forefront of the international agenda. Despite
visible progress in strategic arms reduction, the nuclear powers are accused of
almost sabotaging their disarmament obligations. We cannot agree with this
interpretation, at least with regard to the Russian Federation.
Russia seeks to make its practical contribution to freeing the world from
the threat posed by WMDs, including nuclear weapons. We are committed to the
noble goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. In fully complying with our
international obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (NPT), we bear our fair share of responsibility for preserving peace and
strengthening global security.
As a result of reductions, the total strategic arms capacity of the Russian
Federation has been successively reduced by 85 percent from its peaks in the
1980s. The Russian Federation has reduced its non-strategic nuclear weapons
(NSNWs) by three-quarters of what the USSR had in 1991. All NSNWs have
2
been transferred to the non-deployed category, are located exclusively within the
national territory, and are concentrated in centralized storage facilities with the
highest security regime, which provides a reliable guarantee against accidental or
unauthorized use, not to mention theft.
The Russian Federation continues to fulfill its obligations under the 2010
START Treaty without exemptions or reservations. As of 1 March 2021, Russia
possessed 526 deployed strategic offensive means of delivery and 1,474 warheads
attributed to them under the Treaty. The aggregate number of deployed and nondeployed ballistic missile launchers and heavy bombers as of that date was 761.
The limiting levels we have achieved are significantly lower than those stipulated
in the START Treaty. We publish quantitative data on levels of strategic
offensive weapons for greater transparency. In November 2019, the Russian
Federation held a demonstration for the U.S. side of the Avangard missile system
with a hypersonic boost-glide vehicle. This step serves as further confirmation of
the strict fulfillment of our obligations under the Treaty, aimed primarily at
ensuring the viability and effectiveness of its implementation.
The United States has announced that some of its strategic offensive
weapons have been converted and can no longer be used for nuclear weapons.
However, in the context of the implementation of the START Treaty, we cannot
yet confirm this. As a result, the United States actually possesses more nuclearweapon-delivery vehicles than required by the Treaty. This exceedance allows
the United Statesto build up its strategic nuclear capability by about 1,200 nuclear
warheads in the shortest possible time. We continue to work towards resolving
this issue.
At Russia's initiative, the START Treaty was extended for five years in
February 2021. By agreement between the Presidents of Russia and the United
States, a composite dialogue on strategic stability was initiated. Its key objective
was to lay the foundations for future arms control and risk reduction measures.
We managed to agree on the parameters for building such work. Its ultimate goal,
3
as we saw it, was to develop a new ""security equation"" that would take into
account all factors of strategic stability and encompass both offensive and
defensive nuclear and non-nuclear weapons capable of meeting strategic
challenges.
However, the positive achievements have not been implemented due to the
U.S. policy of achieving military superiority while completely ignoring Russia's
""red lines"" in the field of security. Washington used Russia's rebuff to the attempts
to put us in a vulnerable position as a pretext to ""freeze"" the strategic dialogue.
However, in the absence of cooperation, strategic stability challenges and
contradictions only accumulate and intensify, and the system of arms control,
disarmament and nonproliferation treaties and agreements that has served as the
foundation for international security for decades continues to be subjected to
unprecedented tests. We hope that the understanding of the objective need to
avoid total chaos in strategic affairs and to prevent the development of events in
the worst-case scenario will sooner or later prevail.
Mr. Chairman,
Against this background, it is not surprising that many states are
increasingly expressing serious concerns about the growing nuclear risks and
uncertain prospects for nuclear disarmament. This theme is becoming more and
more apparent in the current NPT review cycle as well.
We note that the possibility of implementing ideas concerning nuclear risk
reduction should be considered in the general context of moving toward reducing
confrontational potential and preventing crises that could lead to direct military
clashes involving nuclear-weapon states.
In this regard, we would like to draw the attention of delegations to the
working paper of the P-5, in which last December a common vision on this issue
was outlined, and to which we remain committed.
More generally, in our view, amid global turbulence and international
political fragmentation, there is a demand, primarily within the NPT framework,
4
for respectful and engaged dialogue as the only possible means of overcoming
disagreements, increasing the level of trust, and finding common ground.
As for nuclear disarmament itself, we are convinced that there are no
shortcuts. It is impossible to achieve real progress in this area simply by
outlawing nuclear weapons.
The international security situation is such that the consolidated efforts of
the ""NPT community"" to create a favorable global climate for the reduction and
elimination of nuclear weapons and to make this process consistent and
sustainable are now particularly needed to make progress toward this goal. In this
respect, the contribution of each NPT state party is valuable. Non-nuclear-weapon
states, along with nuclear-weapon states, should contribute in deed, not in word,
to the overall reduction of international tensions, the promotion of stability, and
a realistic global disarmament agenda, especially in the implementation of Article
VI in its entirety.
Practical progress in disarmament can only be achieved by consensus and
by pursuing a path towards calibrated and phased reductions in the context of
Article VI of the NPT, as well as by respecting the mandatory requirement to
maintain strategic balance based on the principle of equal security. We respect
the views of those who advocate the immediate and unconditional renunciation
of nuclear weapons. At the same time, the attempts to impose on countries
possessing nuclear weapons the speedy elimination of their arsenals are clearly
futile in isolation from existing strategic realities and legitimate security interests
of each of these countries.
The Russian Federation is open to all constructive ideas for multilateral
discussions on nuclear disarmament and on strengthening international security
and stability. Discussions on the topic should be based on consensus and respect
the legitimate interests of all participants in the process. Attempts to force anyone
to participate in them are counterproductive. In our view, the engagement in such
discussions of France and the United Kingdom, as NATO allies of the United
5
States, would be of priority. They possess nuclear arsenals not limited by any
international agreements, which we have to take into account when working on
matters of ensuring the national security of the Russian Federation. We also take
into account the plans announced by London to increase the number of nuclear
warheads.
At the same time, we would like to draw the attention of participants in the
Conference to the fact that NATO openly defines itself as a nuclear alliance,
which was recently reconfirmed by its members at the end of the June summit in
Madrid. U.S. nuclear weapons are still on the territory of non-nuclear allied states.
Practical scenarios for its use involving non-nuclear-weapon states are being
exercised within NATO.The anti-Russian character of such activities has recently
been, in fact, stated by the Minister of Defense of the Federal Republic of
Germany. For his part, the NATO Secretary General has publicly allowed the
deployment of American nuclear weapons in European countries to the east of
Germany.
Such irresponsible actions not only continue to be a significant factor
affecting international and European security, but also increase the risk of nuclear
conflict and generally hamper nuclear disarmament efforts. We have repeatedly
called for the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons to national territory, the
elimination of the infrastructure for their deployment in Europe, and the cessation
of NATO ""joint nuclear missions"".
This policy of the North Atlantic Alliance raises even more concerns about
the creation of the AUKUS partnership by the United States, the United
Kingdom, and Australia. Despite claims that no nuclear warheads will be
transferred to Australia, the military infrastructure of nuclear-weapon states is in
fact expected to be located on its territory. In addition, the planned acquisition by
Australia of nuclear-powered submarines, which are effectively weapons of
unlimited range, is forcing other countries to consider such a massive build-up of
its military capabilities. This raises the question of the goals that the participants
6
in this format of cooperation set for themselves. They need to clarify the situation
and provide complete information on the objectives of their interaction, which
are clearly broader than what is on the surface. Overall, we are concerned about
the trend towards political-military groupings, whose activities may have
negative implications for strategic stability and far-reaching implications for
regional and global security.
Mr. Chairman,
In the current circumstances, it is more critical than ever that the nuclear
powers behave with restraint and responsibility. The Russian Federation is
strongly convinced that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.
The commitment to this principle was reaffirmed by Russia and the United States
in the Presidential Joint Statement of 16 June 2021, as well as by Russia and
China in the Joint Statement of 28 June 2021 on the Twentieth Anniversary of
the Treaty of Good Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation. Furthermore,
Russia and China took a further step by stating that every effort should be made
to prevent any armed conflicts between states with military nuclear capabilities.
This commitment was reaffirmed on 3 January 2022 by the leaders of the
P-5 in the Joint Statement on Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races.
One of the key points of the document is the intention to continue seeking
diplomatic approaches to avoid military confrontations, strengthen stability and
predictability, increase mutual understanding and confidence, and prevent an
arms race that would benefit none and endanger all. It is important that each of
the nuclear-weapon states follow the provisions of this statement in their entirety.
Russia is consistently reducing the place and role of nuclear weapons in
its Military Doctrine.Russia's policy in this area is aimed exclusively at protecting
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. At the same time, priority
is given to the implementation of a set of political and diplomatic measures to
prevent aggression. In the military area, the emphasis is shifted to non-nuclear
means as part of the non-nuclear deterrence system.
7
In accordance with the provisions of the current Military Doctrine, the
Russian Federation reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in two exceptional
cases: in response to the use of nuclear and other types of weapons of mass
destruction against it and (or) its allies, as well as in the event of aggression
against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons, when the
very existence of the state is threatened.
The vision of our country of the essence of nuclear deterrence, the
definitions of military risks and threats to be neutralized through nuclear
deterrence, are specified in the Basic Principles of State Policy of the Russian
Federation on Nuclear Deterrence. This document, issued in June 2020, details
the provisions of the Military Doctrine on nuclear deterrence and allows the
general public to learn in detail about our approaches to their implementation.
Russia's state policy in the area of nuclear deterrence is strictly defensive
in nature and is aimed at maintaining its nuclear capability at a level that provides
guaranteed protection of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state, and
at preventing aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies.
Furthermore, Russian doctrine documents do not define any state as a military
adversary of Russia. This gives us grounds to implement nuclear deterrence
measures only against those states and military coalitions that consider the
Russian Federation as a potential adversary and at the same time possess nuclear
weapons or significant combat potential of general purpose forces that can be
used for aggression against our country.
It is also worth noting that the possession of nuclear weapons, primarily for
deterrence purposes, is the only possible response to certain significant external
threats to the Russian Federation. The development of the situation around
Ukraine confirms the validity of our concerns in this area. By grossly violating
the principle of equal and indivisible security, the NATO bloc has made a bet on
malicious expansion aimed at weakening our country. At the same time, the
United States and its allies rejected the Russian initiative to work out legally
8
binding agreements that would guarantee the restoration of predictability and
stability on Russia's western borders. The countries of the ""collective West"" used
our forced response to protect our external security contour as a pretext to move
into a fierce hybrid confrontation with Russia, dangerously balancing on the edge
of open military conflict. Under these circumstances, abandoning nuclear
weapons would not only drastically weaken our national security but would also
be able to provoke a serious intensification of threats with the risk of further
escalation up to a large-scale military confrontation.
Mr. Chairman,
The U.S. withdrawal from the INF Treaty on 2 August 2019 nullified the
international legal prohibitions on the deployment of land-based intermediaterange and shorter-range missile weapons.
In order to prevent a new devastating nuclear arms race, the Russian
Federation has made a unilateral commitment not to be the first to deploy systems
subject to the Treaty in the relevant regions unless similar U.S.-made missiles are
deployed in there. We call on the U.S. and its allies to undertake similar
commitments.
On 26 October 2020, the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir
Putin in his Statement on Additional Steps to De-escalate the Situation in Europe
in the Context of the Termination of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons, reiterating the initiative on reciprocal moratoria, invited all
parties concerned to consider specific options of reciprocal verification measures
to address existing concerns. Our initiatives remain in force. Please give them
your utmost attention.
We reiterate with a sense of responsibility that Russia has never had and
does not have intermediate- and shorter-range land-based missiles. To assert
otherwise means to create a deliberately false picture and shield those who are
truly responsible for the breakdown of the INF Treaty.
Mr. Chairman,
9
In recent years, nuclear disarmament verification has been actively
promoted in international forums as the hottest topic, and some have presented it
as a panacea for all troubles, capable of overcoming all obstacles on the path to a
nuclear-weapon-free world.
The Russian position on this issue is well known; it has been tested by time
and experience in implementing disarmament agreements. We are convinced that
verification procedures cannot be considered in isolation from specific arms
reduction and limitation agreements and must be consistent with the subject
matter and scope of the limitations contained therein. Therefore, we do not
consider the idea of developing procedures and technologies for nuclear
disarmament verification in advance for their possible use in some speculative
future arrangements to be reasonable from a logical, pragmatic, or negotiating
perspective. In fact, it is a waste of time and resources for a result that knowingly
cannot be implemented in practice.
That said, of course, in the event of substantive work on possible future
arms control arrangements to which Russia will be a party, we will pay due
attention to the verification aspects.
Mr. Chairman,
We would like to stress once again that the Russian Federation fulfills all
of its nuclear disarmament obligations strictly and fully.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","On August 5, Russia reiterated the defensive nature of its nuclear arsenal at the NPT Review Conference. Moscow was “consistently reducing the place and role of nuclear weapons in its Military Doctrine.” Russia’s policy was “aimed exclusively at protecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of

2022-08-05,"President Joe Biden still hopes to shift to a “sole purpose” policy for nuclear weapons in the future, even as his administration’s new Nuclear Posture Review preserves the U.S.’s longstanding policy of “flexible deterrence,” a top Pentagon official said Aug. 5.

Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl, speaking at a side event at the United Nations’ 10th review conference on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, also promised that an unclassified version of the Nuclear Posture Review will be released “in the relatively near future.” A classified version and a brief summary were released in March.

The three-paragraph summary concluded by stating that the U.S. would only consider the use of nuclear weapons “in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners.” 

That marked a walk-back from Biden’s pledge on the campaign trail to formally declare that the U.S.’s sole purpose for having nuclear arms is deterring or responding to a nuclear attack. A sizable group of Democratic lawmakers had also lobbied Biden after he became president to state in the NPR that the U.S. would never use nuclear weapons first in a conflict.

Republicans, on the other hand, vocally opposed such a move, as did allies and partner nations, according to media reports.

Complicating any potential changes in nuclear policy are the threats posed by both Russia and China. During the course of its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has repeatedly raised the threat of using its nuclear arsenal, and China has recently engaged in an expansion of its nuclear capabilities that Pentagon officials have called “breathtaking.”

And so, while “a sole purpose declaratory policy has long been supported by President Biden … the NPR concluded that now is not the time for making that change,” Kahl said. Such a decision ensures “continuity and stability” in U.S. nuclear policy, he added.

At the same time, “we retain the goal of moving towards the sole purpose declaration in the future, and the NPR makes that clear,” Kahl added. “And we will work with our allies and partners to identify concrete steps that will allow us to do so. We also continue to adhere to a negative security assurance not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states that are party to the [Non-Proliferation Treaty] and are in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations.”

The U.S. has released nuclear posture reviews in 1994, 2002, 2010, 2018, and now in 2022. Kahl did not say if or when the Biden administration might release a new Nuclear Posture Review or amend this latest one.

There is also uncertainty regarding China’s goal for its nuclear arsenal, Kahl said. Previously, the Pentagon had estimated that the Chinese had 200 nuclear warheads and would double that number by 2030. More recently, however, those estimates have jumped to 700 warheads by 2027 and 1,000 by 2030. Kahl said that the final number could wind up “quadrupling” what China has now.

All the while, the U.S. and China have not engaged in substantive arms control or strategic stability talks akin to the New START treaty between the U.S. and Russia, Kahl confirmed.

“We are open to strategic stability dialogue conversations with [China]. We are open to initiating conversations on arms control. … The necessary condition for that conversation to happen is a reciprocal willingness from Beijing to entertain those conversations,” Kahl said. “And to date, they have not expressed a willingness to engage in either a sustained strategic stability dialogue or arms control.”

The countries’ leaders, Biden and President Xi Jinping, have mentioned the possibility of such talks in their conversations, Kahl said. But thus far, there has been no follow through.

Instead, tensions are rising over House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s recent visit to Taiwan, which has sparked an intense backlash from China including military exercises surrounding the island, as well as an announcement Aug. 5 that the Chinese military was cutting off communications with their American counterparts.

Kahl criticized the latest move as “bad news” with potentially dangerous consequences.

“Mature responsible nuclear powers don’t cut off military to military contacts and communication in the midst of heightened tensions. They don’t do that because it increases the prospect for misperception and miscalculation,” Kahl said.","US officials in turn suggested that the Administration’s declaratory nuclear policy was, to some degree, linked to Russia’s nuclear narratives. On the same August 5, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl gave a briefing at the United Nations on US nuclear policy. While “a sole purpose declaratory policy has long been supported by President Biden … the NPR concluded that now is not the
time for making that change” in light of, for example, Russia’s nuclear rhetoric, Kahl said","Kahl: It is “not the time” for a sole purpose declaratory policy, in

2022-08-16,"A joint team of Air Force Global Strike Command Airmen and Navy crew members launched an unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile equipped with a test reentry vehicle from aboard the Airborne Launch Control System at 12:49 a.m. Pacific Time Aug. 16 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.

This test launch is part of routine and periodic activities intended to demonstrate that the United States’ nuclear deterrent is safe, secure, reliable and effective to deter twenty-first century threats and reassure our allies. Such tests have occurred more than 300 times before, and this test is not the result of current world events.

Airmen from the 625th Strategic Operations Squadron out of Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, were aboard the U.S. Navy E-6B Mercury aircraft along with crew members from the Navy's Strategic Communications Wing to demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of the ALCS system. The 625 STOS is responsible for the operation of the ALCS weapon system which is a crucial component as the only alternate launch capability for the Minuteman III.  All training and certification of ALCS operations crews and test team members is conducted by the 625 STOS. Additionally, the 625 STOS is responsible for ICBM targeting operations used to configure all GLORY TRIP sorties in their test configuration.

The ICBM's reentry vehicle traveled approximately 4,200 miles to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. These test launches verify the accuracy and reliability of the ICBM weapon system, providing valuable data to ensure a continued safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent.

“Make no mistake - our nuclear triad is the cornerstone of the national security of our country and of our allies around the globe,"" said Col. Chris Cruise, 576th Flight Test Squadron Commander. “This scheduled test launch is demonstrative of how our nation’s ICBM fleet illustrates our readiness and reliability of the weapon system. It is also a great platform to show the skill sets and expertise of our strategic weapons maintenance personnel and of our missile crews who maintain an unwavering vigilance to defend the homeland.”

The test launch is a culmination of months of preparation that involve multiple government partners. The Airmen who perform this vital mission are some of the most skillfully trained and educated the Air Force has to offer.

Airmen from the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom AFB, Montana, 90th Missile Wing at F.E. Warren AFB, Wyoming, and 91st Missile Wing at Minot AFB, North Dakota, were selected for the task force to support the test launch. The three missile bases have crew members standing alert 24 hours a day, year-round, overseeing the nation’s ICBM alert forces. 

""Our test launches are scheduled well in advance and are not reactionary to world events,” said Maj. Armand Wong, Task Force commander. “A meticulous planning process for each launch begins six-months to a year prior to launch. Our best Airmen from each of the three missile wings worked in conjunction with the 576th Flight Test Squadron to proudly showcase some very technical skills that comprise the heart of our nuclear deterrence mission.”

The ICBM community, including the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, and U.S. Strategic Command, uses data collected from test launches for continuing force development evaluation. The ICBM test launch program demonstrates the operational capability of the Minuteman III and ensures the United States’ ability to maintain a strong, credible nuclear deterrent as a key element of U.S. national security and the security of U.S. allies and partners.

Air Force Global Strike Command is a major command with headquarters at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, in the Shreveport-Bossier City community. The command overseas the nation's three intercontinental ballistic missile wings, the Air Force’s entire bomber force, to include B-52, B-1 and B-2 wings, the Long Range Strike Bomber program, Air Force Nuclear Command, Control and Communications systems, and operational and maintenance support to organizations within the nuclear enterprise. Approximately 33,700 professionals are assigned to two Numbered Air Forces, nine wings, two geographically-separated squadrons and one detachment in the continental United States and deployed to locations around the globe.

2022-08-16,"The beginning of the Russian military operation in Ukraine marked the end of the unipolar world. Moscow is opposed by the combined forces of the West, but no one, even in NATO, has any doubts that the goals of the operation will be achieved, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday at the opening of the 10th Moscow Conference on International Security.

The minister stressed that the operation in Ukraine dispelled the myth of a Western ""superweapon"" capable of changing the situation at the front, called allegations about the possibility of using nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory as conjectures and provocations, and also stated the collapse of plans to isolate Russia.

TASS collected the main statements of Shoigu.

On the end of the unipolar world
The unconditional domination of the United States and its allies is a thing of the past - multipolarity has become a reality: ""February 24, 2022, the start of a special military operation in Ukraine, marked the end of the unipolar world.""

""A multipolar world is the reality of today. The transition from the dominance of one global leader to several centers of gravity is not easy, but it creates real conditions for the development of sovereign states.""

On the role of the West in Ukraine
""In Ukraine, Russian military personnel are confronted by the combined forces of the West, who control the leadership of this country in a hybrid war against Russia."" This is not only about financial assistance, the transfer of weapons and intelligence and training of the Ukrainian military - their actions are coordinated by foreign advisers, and ""the use of weapons is carried out under the control of Western experts.""

""NATO's efforts are aimed at prolonging the agony of the Kiev regime. At the same time, we know for certain that no one in NATO has any doubts that the goals of the special military operation set by the Russian leadership will be achieved, and plans to achieve a strategic and economic weakening of Russia are failing.""

About the Western ""superweapon""
""The special military operation dispelled the myth of the 'superweapon' that the West is supplying to Ukraine and which is capable of radically changing the situation at the front. <...> And these weapons are being ground up in battles. They have not had a significant impact on the situation.""

At the same time, the supply of Western weapons to Kyiv means that the responsibility for its inhumane use, the death of the inhabitants of Donbass lies with the countries of the West.

In turn, Russian weapons ""confirmed their best qualities in battles,"" while Moscow carefully studies captured samples and takes into account their qualities in order to improve combat methods and increase the effectiveness of its own weapons.

About the colonial approach
""The role of Kiev in the approach of the West to the conduct of hostilities is reduced to the supply of manpower, which is seen as expendable material. This explains the huge loss of personnel of the armed forces and formations of the territorial defense of Ukraine.""

The Western attitude towards Ukrainian losses confirms that NATO is pursuing ""exclusively selfish interests"": ""Obviously, the colonial experience of Great Britain as the main sponsor of the Kiev regime was very useful to London in its work with the current leadership in Kiev.""

About nuclear weapons in Ukraine
""From a military point of view, there is no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine to achieve the set goals. <...> Allegations about the possible use of chemical weapons in Ukraine are also absurd.""

All these ""information stuffing"" and ""information provocations"" are aimed at diverting attention from the American military biological laboratories on the territory of Ukraine.

About NATO policy
""NATO has dropped its masks. The bloc's aggressive nature has ceased to be hidden behind formulations about the exclusively defensive orientation of coalition activities. Today, claims for global dominance are enshrined in the alliance's strategic planning documents.""

The possible entry of Finland and Sweden into NATO will require a revision of approaches to the defense of Russian territory: ""Some conclusions have already been made and enshrined in the updated Naval Doctrine <...>. Work in this area will continue.""

About arms control
The experience of cooperation with the West in the field of arms control shows that its policy ""does not imply the fulfillment of treaty obligations in the traditional sense,"" and this fact must be taken into account.

In particular, a ""difficult situation"" is developing with the START-3 treaty, which expires in 2026: ""US statements that Russia must earn the right to continue dialogue with the United States do not hold water. Arms control is a two-way street "".

On threats in the Far East
The AUKUS alliance formed by Australia, the UK and the US, as well as plans to create an Australian nuclear submarine fleet, worsen the security situation in the Asia-Pacific region: ""In a global dimension, the appearance of a nuclear fleet in Australia will give other states an excuse to start developing similar weapons. Pandora's box will open, the global nuclear arms race will resume.""

It also cannot be ruled out that NATO's developments in joint nuclear planning and testing of the use of nuclear weapons will be transferred to the Far East: ""The transfer of the practice of nuclear training from Europe will blow up the region. Although it can be assumed that this is precisely the goal set by the United States."" ","On the same August 16, Shoigu again downplayed the nuclear dimension of the conflict. He declared
that “in Ukraine, Russian military personnel are confronted by the combined forces of the West, who
control the leadership of this country in a hybrid war against Russia,” pointing at Western financial
assistance, weapons, training and intelligence provided to Kyiv. Somewhat cryptically, he also
claimed that the “special military operation has dispelled the myth of the 'superweapon' that the
West is supplying to Ukraine and which is capable of radically changing the situation at the front.”
These weapons “have not had a significant impact on the situation.” Further, he pointed out the “huge
loss of personnel of the armed forces and formations of the territorial defense of Ukraine.”
Shoigu also dismissed Western concerns over a potential use of nuclear or chemical weapons as “information provocations” to divert attention from an alleged US biological weapons program in
Ukraine. “From a military point of view, there is no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine to achieve
the set goals. The main purpose of Russian nuclear weapons is to deter a nuclear attack,” he stressed.
“Allegations about the possible use of chemical weapons in Ukraine are also absurd,” added Shoigu.
On arms control, he expressed concern over the “difficult situation” regarding a possible follow-on
agreement for the New Start treaty. The West’s policy did not “imply the fulfillment of treaty obligations in the traditional sense,” he claimed, and “US statements that Russia must earn the right to continue dialogue with the United States do not hold water. Arms control is a two-way street.”"," Shoigu: “From a military point of view, there is no need to
use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.”

2022-08-22,"Russia can use nuclear weapons only in response to an attack - ""for self-defense in emergency circumstances."" This was stated in an interview with Izvestia by Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergei Ryabkov. The diplomat responded in writing to questions about how Moscow sees the dialogue with the United States on disarmament, what it thinks about the threat of nuclear war, and how it assesses the prospects for a new prisoner exchange with Washington.
“The possibility of resuming a strategic dialogue with the United States is far from obvious”
- On August 1, US President Joe Biden said that his administration was ready to quickly negotiate a new arms control system to replace START-3 , and Russia should demonstrate its readiness for such work. Is Moscow ready to discuss this topic with Washington again?

We have repeatedly confirmed that we are open in principle to serious, pragmatic and result-oriented interaction aimed at reducing tensions and risks, preventing a dangerous escalation and arms race, and strengthening strategic stability, including through arms control. We also remember very well that the START Treaty is not open-ended and should ideally be replaced by a new agreement or agreements.

At the same time, it remains to be seen whether the United States will change its deliberately destructive course and whether it will be ready to engage in dialogue on the basis of equality and take into account our interests and security concerns, working together to create the foundations of a new, more just and stable architecture of international security.

The United States has been insisting for years on China's involvement in arms control talks. Russia calls for the participation of Great Britain and France. Considering that Moscow and Washington cannot establish a bilateral dialogue, how realistic is this five-sided format? What are the plans for cooperation with those countries that are not members of the official club of nuclear powers, but possess such weapons?

— We are convinced that attempts to force anyone to engage in dialogue are counterproductive, since such interaction, whether in a bilateral or multilateral format, should imply joint interested work aimed at finding mutually acceptable results. As an illustration, I think it is appropriate to recall the attempts of the Donald Trump administration to force the Chinese side into an arms control dialogue. It looked completely undiplomatic and in some manifestations even curious. As might be expected, China did not succumb to such brutal pressure.

We do not accept such methods. We advocate that any future interaction between the nuclear powers be conducted on the basis of consensus and taking into account the interests of all parties involved. This approach is applicable to any format, both in potential contacts between nuclear powers recognized in the context of the NPT (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. - Izvestia), and with the involvement of other states with military nuclear potentials. Our priority remains the same - to involve Great Britain and France in this process as US military allies within the ""nuclear alliance"". At the same time, it should be taken into account that, in contrast to the dialogue on strategic stability, the possibilities for further progress along the path of nuclear arms reductions only on a bilateral Russian-American basis are practically exhausted.

- The Strategic Stability Dialogue received a new impetus after the extension of START-3 in 2021 - then in Geneva you had several meetings with your colleague, US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman. By the beginning of 2022, they had transformed into negotiations on security guarantees, with strategic stability becoming one of the main topics. After February 24, this dialogue was suspended at the initiative of the United States. Will negotiations start from the same positions on which they were frozen? How realistic is the possibility of reaching agreements on nuclear issues at the same time as Russia is conducting a NMD on the territory of Ukraine ?

- Speculating about the prospects of a strategic dialogue with the United States, especially in the conditions when the Americans interrupted it, is a thankless task. Frankly, the very possibility of its resumption is far from obvious, given the recklessly aggressive policy that Washington is pursuing towards Russia. Naturally, we are monitoring some signals regarding the resumption of dialogue on the subject of strategic offensive arms, but it is still unclear what is behind them. In general, negotiations through the media are not conducted.

As for our vision of the framework of the strategic dialogue and its desired outcomes, all this is known and remains unchanged. Our idea is to develop a ""new security equation"" that would take into account all the factors that affect strategic stability. To this end, we strive to cover the entire spectrum of offensive and defensive, nuclear and non-nuclear weapons with a strategic potential.

- NATO refuses to enter into a conflict on the side of Kyiv, since a direct clash between the alliance and Moscow could lead to a nuclear war. How do you assess the likelihood of such a collision?

- We have repeatedly spoken out on this topic, including at the level of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. As Sergei Lavrov noted, in today's turbulent conditions, nuclear risks are very significant and should not be underestimated. However, they should not be artificially “inflated”.

We believe that one of the most important tasks in this context is to maintain adherence by all the countries of the nuclear five to the postulate of the inadmissibility of any war between countries possessing nuclear weapons. With the aggravation of the Ukrainian crisis, which occurred through the fault of the Kyiv regime and its Western patrons, this message not only has not lost its relevance, but has acquired additional significance.

The destructive course of the NATO countries to ignore our “red lines” and get involved in a confrontation with Russia in Ukraine, balancing on the brink of a direct armed conflict, is extremely risky. It is obvious that this is fraught with further escalation, up to a military clash of nuclear powers with dire consequences. This must be prevented.

- The ""Fundamentals of the State Policy of the Russian Federation in the field of nuclear deterrence"" states that ""aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons"" can serve as a reason for the use of nuclear weapons. Under what conditions is Russia ready to resort to the use of nuclear weapons?

— You quite rightly made a reference to the Fundamentals of the State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Field of Nuclear Deterrence. The doctrinal guidelines contained in this document are extremely clear: Russia hypothetically allows a nuclear response only in response to aggression using WMD against us or our allies, or aggression using conventional weapons, when the very existence of the state is threatened. The key word in both scenarios is ""aggression"". In other words, the use of nuclear weapons by Russia is possible only in response to an attack - for self-defense in emergency circumstances. There is no place for conjectures or fantasies here.

Washington has previously proposed to exchange Russian prisoner Viktor Bout for Americans Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner. How realistic is this proposal? When and under what conditions can this exchange take place?

- The issue of the exchange of imprisoned citizens of Russia and the United States is a very sensitive matter, which is unacceptable to be put on public display, as the current American administration is doing, in order to earn political points.

We have repeatedly called on Washington to observe the rules of ""quiet diplomacy"" without interfering with the competent bodies of Russia and the United States, which are authorized by our presidents to seek solutions on specific exchange options, from doing their job professionally. This is how we managed to free Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko, who was serving a 20-year term in an American prison on trumped-up charges, in parallel with the transfer to the United States of student Trevor Reed, who was convicted in our country for attacking a policeman.

It remains to be hoped that the American side will refrain from slipping into propaganda and will act responsibly, following the principle of ""do no harm.""","De-escalation also appeared to be on Russian minds. In an interview on August 22, Russian Deputy
Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov confirmed a restrictive approach to any potential use of nuclear
weapons. Referring back to Lavrov’ statement from April 25 that the nuclear risks were real but
should not be “inflated,” he noted that “one of the most important tasks … is to maintain adherence by
all the nuclear five states to the postulate of the inadmissibility of any war between countries possessing nuclear weapons.” In this context he condemned the NATO countries’ “destructive course” to
“ignore” Russian “red lines” and “get involved in a confrontation with Russia in Ukraine, balancing on
the brink of direct armed conflict.” This was “extremely risky” and “fraught with further escalation,
up to a military clash of nuclear powers with dire consequences,” he explained. “This must be prevented.” He then also referred to Russian doctrine, which clearly laid down that “Russia hypothetically allows a nuclear response only in response to aggression using WMD against us or our allies, or
aggression using conventional weapons, when the very existence of the state is threatened.” Hence: The key word in both scenarios is aggression,” meaning that “the use of nuclear weapons by Russia is
possible only in response to an attack - for self-defense in emergency circumstances,” he explained. “There is no place for conjectures or fantasies here.”489
Finally, Ryabkov added, Moscow remained “open in principle to serious, pragmatic and result-oriented interaction aimed at reducing tensions and risks, preventing a dangerous escalation and arms
race, and strengthening strategic stability, including through arms control.” The START Treaty “ideally should be replaced by a new agreement or agreements.” However, he blamed the United States
on the lack of progress in this regard. The resumption of bilateral strategic talks between Moscow
and Washington was unlikely due to the latter’s “deliberately destructive course"," Ryabkov: Clash between nuclear powers must be prevented.
