 Peskov: Any outcome of the operation in Ukraine is “of
course” not a reason to use nuclear weapons, only an existential threat would be. But: Everyone understands what Putin meant with his warning “not to interfere.” And: He does “not
think” Putin would use nuclear weapons if a third country intervened in Ukraine. But: Russia
has “all the possibilities” to punish such states. But: “No one is thinking about using, even
about the idea of using a nuclear weapon.”
