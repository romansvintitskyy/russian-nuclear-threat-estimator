2022-01-27 00:00:00,"A month before the invasion, the Russian leadership started to bring its nuclear arsenal into the political narrative, already suggesting an expansive interpretation of the official doctrine.",r,W
2022-01-27 00:00:00,"Dmitry Medvedev, the Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council and a former president and prime minister, stated in an interview on January 27, that there was no need to review Russia’s nuclear doctrine.",r,W
2022-01-27 00:00:00,"Moscow had “the right” to use strategic nuclear forces “in response to an attack involving weapons of mass destruction against us or our allies and in response to any other threat to our country’s existence, in other words, to a danger that threatens the very existence of our state”.",r,W
2022-01-27 00:00:00,"This was “a comprehensive formula” that made it “possible to achieve various goals,” Medvedev said.",r,W
2022-02-07 00:00:00,"Ten days later, Putin continued developing the nuclear narrative.",r,E
2022-02-07 00:00:00,"On February 7, the Russian President implied at a joint press conference with French President Emanuel Macron during the latter’s visit to Moscow that Ukraine could drag NATO into a nuclear war.",r,E
2022-02-07 00:00:00,"If Ukraine joined NATO and decided to take back Crimea through military means, European countries would be automatically drawn into a military conflict with Russia, Putin said.",r,E
2022-02-07 00:00:00,"The Kremlin understood that “NATO’s united potential” was incomparably larger than that of Russia, but Russia was “one of the world’s leading nuclear powers” and was “superior” to “many” NATO countries “in terms of the number of modern nuclear force components”.",r,E
2022-02-07 00:00:00,Putin claimed that neither he nor Macron wanted to see developments “unfold” that way,r,E
2022-02-19 00:00:00,"On February 19, sitting alongside Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, Putin oversaw an annual “strategic nuclear exercise,” usually held in fall.",r,W
2022-02-19 00:00:00,"Russian forces tested nuclear-capable air-, sea-, and land-based ballistic and cruise missiles",r,W
2022-02-22 00:00:00,"In a televised address on February 21, Putin accused Ukraine of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons and stated that the possibility of “foreign technological support” could not be ruled out.",r,W
2022-02-22 00:00:00,"16 On February 22, he sought to clarify his earlier statement, stating that tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine would be a “strategic threat” to Russia",r,W
2022-02-24 00:00:00,"Washington was pursuing a “policy of containing Russia, with obvious geopolitical dividends,” Putin added.",r,E
2022-02-24 00:00:00,"However, NATO’s policy was for Russia “a matter of life and death”.",r,E
2022-02-24 00:00:00,"The Western actions were “not only a very real threat” to Russia’s interests but to “the very existence” of the state and to its “sovereignty,” Putin said.",r,E
2022-02-24 00:00:00,"Hence, he addressed “those who may be tempted to interfere in these developments from the outside,” saying that “no matter” who tried to stand in Russia’s way or “create threats for our country and our people,” had to know that “Russia will respond immediately, and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history” – what many interpreted as a veiled threat to employ nuclear weapons against those who interfered in Russia’s attempt to eliminate an existential threat.",r,E
2022-02-24 00:00:00,"Later in the same speech, Putin also emphasized that Russia was “one of the most powerful nuclear states” and had a “certain advantage in several cutting-edge weapons”.",r,W
2022-02-24 00:00:00,"Within this clearly nuclear context, however, the Russian President defined the preconditions for a possible nuclear strike much more narrowly: “There should be no doubt for anyone that any potential aggressor will face defeat and ominous consequences should it directly attack our country”.",r,W
2022-02-24 00:00:00,"That a direct attack on Russia could be answered with nuclear weapons was consistent with both Russia’s nuclear doctrine, adopted in 2020, and the declaratory policies of other nuclear powers",r,W
2022-02-24 00:00:00,Representatives of NATO countries strongly condemned the Russian invasion.,w,D
2022-02-24 00:00:00,"On February 24, US President Biden condemned the “brutal assault [by the Russian military] on the people of Ukraine without provocation, without justification, without necessity”.",w,D
2022-02-24 00:00:00,He noted that NATO would convene to “map out the next steps” to “further strengthen all aspects” of the Alliance”.,w,D
2022-02-24 00:00:00,25 Biden added: “Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine.,w,D
2022-02-24 00:00:00,Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but to defend our NATO Allies and reassure those Allies in the east”.,w,D
2022-02-24 00:00:00,"However, the United States would “defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power” and the Alliance was “more united and more determined than ever”.",w,D
2022-02-24 00:00:00,Other NATO Allies expressed similar outrage.,w,W
2022-02-24 00:00:00,"French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian called Putin a “cynic” and a “dictator” on February 24 and issued a first nuclear counter-threat, saying that the Russian President had to understand that the transatlantic Alliance was also a nuclear alliance”.",w,W
2022-02-26 00:00:00,"Western statements, in turn, were accompanied by actions, which however remained limited to economic sanctions and military aid.",w,D
2022-02-26 00:00:00,"Thus, in the days following the invasion, the United States, the European Union, many other European states, but also Canada, Japan, and Australia, adopted an unprecedented sanctions package against Russia;29 and on February 26, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby announced “an additional $350 million in military assistance” for Ukraine, “including anti-armor, small arms and various munitions, body armor, and related equipment in support of Ukraine’s front-line defenders facing down Russia’s unprovoked attack”.",w,D
2022-02-27 00:00:00,"Nonetheless, certain Western statements could have been interpreted by Russian policymakers as laying the ground for a direct intervention.",w,E
2022-02-27 00:00:00,British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on February 27 that the immense costs of the war could well be the beginning of the end for Putin.,w,E
2022-02-27 00:00:00,"She feared, however, that Putin was determined to use the most unsightly means.",w,E
2022-02-27 00:00:00,"Thus, she urged Russia, not to escalate the conflict, but noted that the West had to be prepared for Russia trying to use even the worst weapons.",w,E
2022-02-27 00:00:00,"The “long-running conflict” in Ukraine was “about freedom and democracy in Europe,” Truss noted.",w,E
2022-02-27 00:00:00,"“If we don’t stop Putin in Ukraine, we are going to see others under threat: the Baltics, Poland, Moldova, and it could end up in a conflict with NATO.",w,E
2022-02-27 00:00:00,"We do not want to go there,” she warned, suggesting (intentionally or not) that the Western stakes warranted a direct intervention.",w,E
2022-02-27 00:00:00,3,w,E
2022-02-27 00:00:00,"Even more disconcerting than the decision in Minsk, on February 27, Putin ordered Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and Armed Forces Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov to put Russia’s “deterrence forces,” which include nuclear weapons, on a “high combat alert”.",r,E
2022-02-27 00:00:00,"Putin cited “unfriendly economic actions” taken against Russia by Western countries, namely the “illegitimate sanctions,” and “aggressive statements” directed at Russia as reasons for the decision.",r,E
2022-02-27 00:00:00,35 It was not initially clear what specific steps would accompany this decision.,r,E
2022-02-27 00:00:00,3,r,E
2022-02-28 00:00:00,"Then, on February 28, Shoigu declared that he had implemented Putin’s order by adding additional personnel at various locations – “shifts on duty” at “command posts” had been “put on enhanced combat duty”.",r,W
2022-02-28 00:00:00,37 Experts consequently classified the decision as largely symbolic.,r,W
2022-02-28 00:00:00,"White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki saw the Russian decision as part of a typical pattern of the Kremlin, artificially fabricating threats to justify further aggressive actions.",w,D
2022-02-28 00:00:00,"Russia had not been threatened by NATO or Ukraine at any time, she said.",w,D
2022-02-28 00:00:00,"The United States had the ability to defend itself, but it also had to speak out against what Putin was doing, Psaki continued, noting that Washington was “open” to providing additional assistance to Ukraine.",w,D
2022-02-27 00:00:00,"Also on February 27, as a result of a foreign ministers’ meeting, the European Union announced the delivery of weapons and lethal support to Ukraine worth 450 million euros.",w,W
2022-02-27 00:00:00,"In a press conference, Josep Borrell, the European Union’s top diplomat, stated that this would include the delivery of fighter jets, which Ukraine had asked for: “We are going to supply arms and even fighter jets.",w,W
2022-02-27 00:00:00,"We are not talking just about ammunition; we are providing the most important arms to go to war,” Borell said.",w,W
2022-02-27 00:00:00,“We know what kind of planes [the Ukrainian army can operate] and some Member States have these kinds of planes”.,w,W
2022-02-27 00:00:00,"43 Borell was referring to fighter jets of the Soviet MiG or Sukhoi type, which for example Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia reportedly owned.",w,W
2022-02-27 00:00:00,44 Media later suggested that several Western governments had hoped a potential delivery of fighter jets would not be made public.,w,W
2022-02-27 00:00:00,"45 In addition, Borrell said Poland had agreed to act as a “logistical hub” for the delivery of such “material assistance”.",w,W
2022-02-28 00:00:00,"Much more significant than these public statements, however, was the fact that Washington probably warned Moscow on February 28 or March 1 through government channels against using tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine.",w,E
2022-02-28 00:00:00,"US media reported this in mid-March, citing statements by US officials from the National Security Council",w,E
2022-02-28 00:00:00,"Russia’s rhetoric, meanwhile, remained unchanged.",r,E
2022-02-28 00:00:00,"On February 28, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, stated in an interview that it would be a “golden dream” for the United States to deploy nuclear weapons in Ukraine",r,E
2022-03-01 00:00:00,"On March 1, Russia held another military exercise involving nuclear submarines in the Barents Sea and the deployment of mobile intercontinental ballistic missile systems in Siberia.",r,W

2022-02-28 00:00:00,"51 In his State of the Union address on March 1, he further reiterated that US forces “are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine”.",w,D
2022-02-28 00:00:00,"Hence: “Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies – in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west,” the US President said.",w,D
2022-02-28 00:00:00,He had made “crystal clear the United States and [its] Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power.,w,D
2022-03-02 00:00:00,"Just one week after it had been announced, the delivery of fighter jets by EU states was put on hold – apparently also mainly due to efforts to avoid escalation with Russia.",w,D
2022-03-02 00:00:00,"For example, at a joint press conference with Stoltenberg on March 2, Polish President Andrzej Duda declared his country was not sending “any jets to Ukraine because that would open a military interference in the Ukrainian conflict”.",w,D
2022-03-02 00:00:00,"Poland was “not joining that conflict,” and NATO was “not a party to that conflict”.",w,D
2022-03-02 00:00:00,Warsaw was “supporting Ukrainians with humanity aid” but was not “going to send any jets to the Ukrainian airspace”.,w,D
2022-03-02 00:00:00,"Stoltenberg made similar comments, noting that the Alliance had provided “different types of military support: material, anti-tank weapons, air defense systems and other types of military equipment” as well as financial support, but that NATO was “not to be part of the conflict” and was not “going to send the troops into Ukraine or move planes into Ukrainian airspace”.",w,D

2022-03-02 00:00:00,"“Now, in this time of heightened tensions, the United States and other members of the international community rightly saw [Putin’s actions] as dangerous and irresponsible and … an unnecessary step,” Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby said.",w,D
2022-03-02 00:00:00,"“To demonstrate that we have no intention of engaging in any actions that can be misunderstood or misconstrued, the secretary of defense has directed that our Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile test launch scheduled for this week to be postponed,” he further commented on Austin’s decision.",w,D

2022-03-03 00:00:00,"Perhaps you are confusing us with the United States, but the Russian Federation has never spoken about this”.",r,D
2022-03-03 00:00:00,"61 In a March 3 interview, Foreign Minister Lavrov stated that the goal of Russia’s “military operation” in Ukraine was to prevent Kyiv from acquiring nuclear weapons.",r,D
2022-03-03 00:00:00,"In addition, he made somewhat cryptic comments about a possible war with the West, yet arguing that Moscow’s nuclear rhetoric was merely a reaction to Western threats.",r,D
2022-03-03 00:00:00,"Thus, Lavrov noted that the French Foreign Minister le Drian had reminded the Russian leadership that France also had nuclear weapons (see February 24).",r,D

2022-03-03 00:00:00,"But if a real war is unleashed against us, this must be a concern for those who are hatching such plans.",r,D

2022-03-04 00:00:00,"64 In the press conference that followed the summit, Stoltenberg condemned Russia’s “irresponsible” actions near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility.",w,D
2022-03-04 00:00:00,"However, he stressed that NATO was “not part of this conflict” and was not seeking war with Russia.",w,D
2022-03-04 00:00:00,"The Alliance had a responsibility to ensure that the conflict did not escalate and spread, he said.",w,D
2022-03-04 00:00:00,That scenario would be even more destructive and dangerous.,w,D
2022-03-04 00:00:00,"Stoltenberg also said that NATO continued to believe in arms control, but that such negotiations would require a Russian regime that takes political processes seriously.",w,D

2022-03-05 00:00:00,"Similar to Lavrov, Putin also claimed that Ukraine was trying to obtain nuclear weapons and still had relevant capabilities from Soviet times.",r,W
2022-03-05 00:00:00,"He described the Western sanctions against Russia as tantamount to “war,” even though “thankfully” the conflict had “not got” to a hot war “yet”.",r,W
2022-03-05 00:00:00,"Putin explained that Russia’s “so-called partners” understood what a NFZ “could lead to” and how much was at stake, “despite their reckless statements, for example, like the statement made by the UK Foreign Secretary, when she blurted out that NATO could get involved in the conflict.",r,W
2022-03-05 00:00:00,And we immediately had to take a decision to put our deterrence forces on high alert” (see Truss on February 27 and Lavrov’s statement on March 3),r,W

2022-03-08 00:00:00,"Still, Putin was unlikely to be deterred by such blowback.",w,D
2022-03-08 00:00:00,"Instead, he might escalate further to force a disarmament of Ukraine and its neutrality, and to prevent Kyiv from moving any closer to the United States or to NATO.",w,D
2022-03-08 00:00:00,The US intelligence community assessed that Putin perceived the West as not respecting him enough.,w,D
2022-03-08 00:00:00,"The Russian president probably thought he could not afford to lose this war, Haines said.",w,D

2022-03-08 00:00:00,"Putin’s nuclear saber rattling fit this assessment very well, Haines added.",w,D
2022-03-08 00:00:00,"Nonetheless, the public announcement of a heightened alert of Russian deterrent forces was highly unusual.",w,D
2022-03-08 00:00:00,"The United States had not seen such public pronouncements since the 1960s, Haines pointed out.",w,D
2022-03-08 00:00:00,"But the US intelligence community had not observed any specific adjustments in Russia’s nuclear forces, going beyond what had occurred in previous moments of heightened tensions in recent decades.",w,D
2022-03-08 00:00:00,"Putin’s nuclear threatening gestures were likely intended to discourage the West from providing additional support to Ukraine, Haines said.",w,D
2022-03-08 00:00:00,"Putin was probably still confident that Russia could defeat Ukraine and wanted to prevent Western support that could tip the balance and force a conflict with NATO, she concluded",w,D

2022-03-11 00:00:00,"On the same day, Biden also stressed that while the United States would “defend every inch of NATO territory with the full might of a united and galvanized NATO,” Washington would “not fight a war against Russia in Ukraine”.",w,D
2022-03-11 00:00:00,The reason: “A direct confrontation between NATO and Russia is World War III.,w,D

2022-03-16 00:00:00,"Referring to the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act, which had ruled out the permanent stationing of NATO troops on the territory of the former Warsaw Pact states, he stressed that today we were in a “totally different security environment”.",w,D
2022-03-16 00:00:00,The Alliance would not let this document “create problems or hindrance for NATO to make the necessary decisions”.,w,D

2022-03-16 00:00:00,"The West, he said, wanted to “cancel” Russia, “to finish [it] off, to reduce [it] to nothing by turning [it] into a weak and dependent country, destroying [its] territorial integrity and dismembering Russia”.",r,W

2022-04-27 00:00:00,All the decisions have been made in this regard,r,E
2022-04-28 00:00:00,"The following day, on April 28, US Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan showed himself and Washington undeterred by this renewed Russian threat making, instead confirming the new broader US goals in the war as laid out by previous US statements.",w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,"Accordingly, Washington would “do all” it could to ensure that the Russian decision to invade was “a strategic defeat for [Putin] and his government, and not a victory for him in Ukraine”.",w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,"While Russia’s nuclear rhetoric was not new, it had recently escalated in “a dramatically irresponsible way,” noted Sullivan.",w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,Washington by contrast was not engaging in “irresponsible rhetoric with respect to nuclear weapons” and was “prepared to deter nuclear aggression against the United States”.,w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,"Hence: “We won’t succumb to nuclear blackmail,” nor “tolerate nuclear saber rattling and nuclear brinksmanship,” Sullivan concluded",w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,"In parallel, also on April 28, Biden however appeared to implicitly acknowledge Russian concerns over external interference in Ukraine.",w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,"Even before the war he had “made clear” that Washington would “[not] send US troops to fight Russian troops in Ukraine, but ...",w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,"would provide robust military assistance” and “try to unify the Western world against Russia’s aggression,” he explained.",w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,"“Despite the disturbing rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin, the facts are plain for everybody to see,” Biden declared.",w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,"“We’re not attacking Russia; we’re helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression,” including with significant intelligence and military assistance.",w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,"Yet, Biden rejected Russian claims that the war in Ukraine was a “life-or-death struggle” and a RussiaNATO “proxy war”.",w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,"These statements were concerning, explained Biden, because they showed “the desperation that Russia is feeling about their abject failure in being able to do what they set out to do in the first instance”.",w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,"Instead of saying that the … Ukrainians, equipped with some capability to resist Russian forces, are … [causing Moscow’s military failures in Ukraine], they’ve got to … tell their people the United States and all of NATO is engaged … in taking out Russian troops and tanks.",w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,… It’s an excuse for their failure.,w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,But …no one should be making idle comments about the use of nuclear weapons.,w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,… It’s irresponsible.,w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,"Asked whether he was concerned that Russia might start acting as if it was engaged in a proxy war with Washington, Biden said the United States was “prepared for whatever they do”.",w,W
2022-04-28 00:00:00,"However, the United States would only send military assistance, not troops, to Ukraine.",w,W
2022-04-29 00:00:00,"The same day, April 29, Lavrov qualified his earlier statements about the risks of nuclear war.",r,D
2022-04-29 00:00:00,His words had been taken out of context.,r,D
2022-04-29 00:00:00,"In fact, he had stressed that Russia had been “champions of making pledges by all nuclear countries never to start a nuclear war” and had repeatedly insisted on such a declaration with other nuclear powers.",r,D

2022-04-29 00:00:00,"But to make sure that this is the case, the West must discipline speakers like our Ukrainian and Polish colleagues who see no danger in playing with such very, very risky words.",r,D
2022-04-29 00:00:00,"In addition, Lavrov clarified that Russia did not see itself at war with NATO, but that Western arms deliveries were a legitimate military target for Russian forces once they reached Ukrainian territory.",r,D
2022-04-29 00:00:00,We do not see ourselves at war with NATO because this is exactly another step … to increase the risks of what we just discussed.,r,D

2022-05-05 00:00:00,"On May 5, Russian Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov explained that nuclear weapons could only “be used in response to the use of WMD against Russia and its allies, or in the event of aggression against our country, when the very existence of the state is jeopardized”.",r,D
2022-05-05 00:00:00,The decision to raise the alert level of Russia’s deterrent forces had been “misinterpreted” by the West.,r,D

2022-05-05 00:00:00,"This meant that Russia had “increased its vigilance against the backdrop of extremely confrontational statements by Western countries, including NATO member states that possess nuclear weapons,” clarified Antonov.",r,D
2022-05-05 00:00:00,"He concluded: Russia did not “threaten the United States and its European allies, but, on the contrary, is making every effort to prevent the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.",r,D

2022-05-05 00:00:00,"In contrast, the “current generation of NATO politicians clearly does not take the nuclear threat seriously,” Antonov complained, pointing at what he saw as “a flurry of blatant misrepresentation of Russian officials’ statements on our country’s nuclear policy”.",r,D
2022-05-05 00:00:00,"Moreover, he reiterated claims that Ukraine had intended to obtain nuclear weapons and had a biological weapons program, while criticizing Poland’s openness to host US nuclear weapons.",r,D
2022-05-05 00:00:00,"Nevertheless, Antonov also highlighted Russia’s interest in reaching “agreements that will guarantee that a catastrophic confrontation will not be unleashed,” pointing to Moscow’s efforts to restate that there could be no winners in a nuclear war with Biden and the other P5 states.",r,D
2022-05-05 00:00:00,"Further, he stressed the importance of the New START agreement as a “universally recognized gold standard in the sphere of maintaining strategic stability and transparency between the major nuclear powers,” claiming that “Russia has repeatedly drawn the attention of the United States that it is important to continue the joint work on an agreement that could replace New START and accommodate new realities of international security and development of military technologies”.",r,D

2022-05-10 00:00:00,Putin was “preparing for prolonged conflict” during which he still intended to “achieve goals beyond the Donbas“ as he “most likely” also judged that Russia had “a greater ability and willingness to endure challenges than his adversaries”.,w,W
