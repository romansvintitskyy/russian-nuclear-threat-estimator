Against this background, US military officials noted fighter jets could be supplied, but clarified the restricted nature of nuclear deterrence. On the same July 20, US Air Force Chief of Staff Charles Q.
Brown declared the United States might be willing provide fighter jets to Kyiv. “There’s U.S. [fighter
jets], there’s Gripen out of Sweden, there’s the Eurofighter or the Rafale. So there’s a number of different platforms that could go to Ukraine,” explained Brown.
Asked what the United States would do if Putin decided to use a tactical nuclear weapon inside
Ukraine, he declared that this was a policy question “for the President to decide.” The US military’s
responsibility was “to provide the President options.” Whatever these options might be, “it’s all about
deterrence. The goal is not to get into a conflict broader than the conflict that’s already going on today
and definitely not into a nuclear conflict,” Brown stressed. “Because of our strategic deterrence we
provide umbrella security with many of our allies and partners and we’ve got to be responsible about
how we do that … there’s a range of options that you could do but by the same token there’s a lot of
risk,” he explained. The US government would need to make sure that these options would not lead it
down a “slippery slope that we can’t recover from.”4
