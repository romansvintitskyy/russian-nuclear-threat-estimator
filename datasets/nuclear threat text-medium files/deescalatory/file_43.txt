Meanwhile on the same day, April 14, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director William Burns put
into perspective nuclear escalation concerns. Asked about his agency’s risk assessment of a possible
use of tactical nuclear weapons, he explained that though the situation had to be taken seriously, no
“practical evidence” indicated Russian preparations for such a scenario.
President Biden is deeply concerned about avoiding a third world war, about avoiding a threshold in which ... nuclear conflict becomes possible. ... Russian military doctrine holds that you
could escalate to de-escalate. ... Some Russian leaders have talked about a circumstance in
which … NATO would intervene militarily on the ground in Ukraine. ... That’s not something, as
President Biden has made very clear, that’s in the cards, but … given the potential desperation of
President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they’ve faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons
or low-yield nuclear weapons. … While we’ve seen some rhetorical posturing on the part of the
Kremlin about moving to higher nuclear alert levels, so far we haven’t seen a lot of practical evidence of the kind of deployments or … military dispositions that would … reinforce that concern.
But we watch for that very intently. 2
