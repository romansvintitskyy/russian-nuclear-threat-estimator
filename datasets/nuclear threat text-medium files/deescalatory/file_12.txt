White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki saw the Russian decision as part of a typical pattern of the
Kremlin, artificially fabricating threats to justify further aggressive actions. Russia had not been
threatened by NATO or Ukraine at any time, she said. The United States had the ability to defend itself, but it also had to speak out against what Putin was doing, Psaki continued, noting that Washington was “open” to providing additional assistance to Ukraine.
