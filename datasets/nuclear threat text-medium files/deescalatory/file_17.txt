In a press conference on February 28, US President Joe Biden denied the question of whether Americans should be afraid of nuclear war.51 In his State of the Union address on March 1, he further reiterated that US forces “are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.”
Hence: “Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies – in the
event that Putin decides to keep moving west,” the US President said. He had made “crystal clear the
United States and [its] Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force
of our collective power.
