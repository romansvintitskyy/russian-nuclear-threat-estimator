On the same August 16, Shoigu again downplayed the nuclear dimension of the conflict. He declared
that “in Ukraine, Russian military personnel are confronted by the combined forces of the West, who
control the leadership of this country in a hybrid war against Russia,” pointing at Western financial
assistance, weapons, training and intelligence provided to Kyiv. Somewhat cryptically, he also
claimed that the “special military operation has dispelled the myth of the 'superweapon' that the
West is supplying to Ukraine and which is capable of radically changing the situation at the front.”
These weapons “have not had a significant impact on the situation.” Further, he pointed out the “huge
loss of personnel of the armed forces and formations of the territorial defense of Ukraine.”
Shoigu also dismissed Western concerns over a potential use of nuclear or chemical weapons as “information provocations” to divert attention from an alleged US biological weapons program in
Ukraine. “From a military point of view, there is no need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine to achieve
the set goals. The main purpose of Russian nuclear weapons is to deter a nuclear attack,” he stressed.
“Allegations about the possible use of chemical weapons in Ukraine are also absurd,” added Shoigu.
On arms control, he expressed concern over the “difficult situation” regarding a possible follow-on
agreement for the New Start treaty. The West’s policy did not “imply the fulfillment of treaty obligations in the traditional sense,” he claimed, and “US statements that Russia must earn the right to continue dialogue with the United States do not hold water. Arms control is a two-way street.”
