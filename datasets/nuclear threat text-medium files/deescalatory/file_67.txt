Yet, Russian mid-level officials continued to downplay Moscow’s nuclear narratives. On May 29, Russia’s ambassador to the United Kingdom Andrey Kelin confirmed that Russia would not use nuclear
weapons over Ukraine. According to Russian doctrine tactical nuclear weapons were “not used in
conflicts like [the one in Ukraine] at all,” he explained. As per its “very strict provisions,” tactical nuclear weapons would mainly be used “when the existence of the state is endangered.” This had “nothing to do with the current operation,” which remained a “limited conventional operation” as indicated
by Russia not increasing the number of its forces in Ukraine, he added.
