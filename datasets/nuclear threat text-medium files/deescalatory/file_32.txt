Once again, some Russian officials started to walk back their government’s nuclear narratives. For instance, in a March 22 interview, Kremlin spokesman Peskov again claimed that Ukraine had sought
to develop nuclear weapons. However, when asked whether Putin would use nuclear weapons, he

to the corresponding clauses of the Russian military doctrine and corresponding points of the basics
of state policy on nuclear deterrence.” Russia had “an extremely responsible approach to this matter”
and would “never escalate anything.
