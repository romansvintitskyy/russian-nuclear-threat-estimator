Returning to nuclear issues, on June 2, US President Joe Biden stressed the importance of discussions on the future of arms control, writing: “Our progress must continue beyond the New START extension. Even as we rally the world to hold Russia accountable for its brutal and unprovoked war on
Ukraine, we must continue to engage Russia on issues of strategic stability. Today—perhaps more
than any other time since the Cold War—we must work to reduce the risk of an arms race or nuclear
escalation.”
