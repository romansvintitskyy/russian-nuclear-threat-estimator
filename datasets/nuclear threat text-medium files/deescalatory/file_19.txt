Last but not least, US Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III on March 2 postponed a planned test
launch of the US Minuteman III missile. “Now, in this time of heightened tensions, the United States
and other members of the international community rightly saw [Putin’s actions] as dangerous and
irresponsible and … an unnecessary step,” Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby said. “To demonstrate that we have no intention of engaging in any actions that can be misunderstood or misconstrued, the secretary of defense has directed that our Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile
test launch scheduled for this week to be postponed,” he further commented on Austin’s decision.
“We did not take this decision lightly, but instead to demonstrate that we are a responsible nuclear
power.”6
