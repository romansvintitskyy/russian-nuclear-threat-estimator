Zelenskyy’s NFZ request was however denied at an extraordinary NATO foreign ministers’ meeting to
address the situation in Ukraine on March 4 – with reference to the associated risk of escalation.64 In
the press conference that followed the summit, Stoltenberg condemned Russia’s “irresponsible” actions near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility. However, he stressed that NATO was “not part of this
conflict” and was not seeking war with Russia. The Alliance had a responsibility to ensure that the
conflict did not escalate and spread, he said. That scenario would be even more destructive and dangerous. Stoltenberg also said that NATO continued to believe in arms control, but that such negotiations would require a Russian regime that takes political processes seriously. According to Stoltenberg, the Allies had rejected the establishment of a no-fly zone because such a direct engagement of
NATO states could lead to a larger war in Europe
