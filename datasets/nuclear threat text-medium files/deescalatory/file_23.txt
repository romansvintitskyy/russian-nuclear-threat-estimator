Also on March 8, the US House of Representatives Select Intelligence Committee held a hearing to assess Russia’s nuclear threats. At that hearing, Avril Haines, the Director of National Intelligence,
stated that Russia had probably underestimated the international response to the invasion of
Ukraine. Still, Putin was unlikely to be deterred by such blowback. Instead, he might escalate further
to force a disarmament of Ukraine and its neutrality, and to prevent Kyiv from moving any closer to
the United States or to NATO. The US intelligence community assessed that Putin perceived the West
as not respecting him enough. The Russian president probably thought he could not afford to lose this
war, Haines said. What kind of victory he was willing to accept might change over time, due to the
war’s significant costs, she noted.
Putin’s nuclear saber rattling fit this assessment very well, Haines added. Nonetheless, the public announcement of a heightened alert of Russian deterrent forces was highly unusual. The United States had not seen such public pronouncements since the 1960s, Haines pointed out. But the US intelligence community had not observed any specific adjustments in Russia’s nuclear forces, going beyond
what had occurred in previous moments of heightened tensions in recent decades. Putin’s nuclear
threatening gestures were likely intended to discourage the West from providing additional support
to Ukraine, Haines said. Putin was probably still confident that Russia could defeat Ukraine and
wanted to prevent Western support that could tip the balance and force a conflict with NATO, she
concluded
