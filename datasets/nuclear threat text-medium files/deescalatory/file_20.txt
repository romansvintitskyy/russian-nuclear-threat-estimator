On March 2, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova expressed skepticism with
regard to a possible Russian nuclear escalation. “We assume that this apocalyptic scenario [of Russia
using nuclear weapons first] cannot be realized under any pretext and under any conditions,” she said. “When it comes to the use of nuclear weapons, we have already stated our position several
times. Perhaps you are confusing us with the United States, but the Russian Federation has never spoken about this.”61
In a March 3 interview, Foreign Minister Lavrov stated that the goal of Russia’s “military operation”
in Ukraine was to prevent Kyiv from acquiring nuclear weapons. In addition, he made somewhat
cryptic comments about a possible war with the West, yet arguing that Moscow’s nuclear rhetoric
was merely a reaction to Western threats. Thus, Lavrov noted that the French Foreign Minister le
Drian had reminded the Russian leadership that France also had nuclear weapons (see February 24).
The Russian official also commented that British Foreign Secretary Truss had said “she was prepared
for conflict between NATO and Russia” (see February 27). Also, he added that US President Biden had
said that the alternative to sanctioning Russia was World War III. “I would like to draw your attention
to the fact that the thought of nuclear war is constantly running through the minds of Western politicians but not the minds of Russians,” Lavrov concluded. “I assure you that we will not let any provocations cause us to lose our balance. But if a real war is unleashed against us, this must be a concern for
those who are hatching such plans. And I believe these plans are being hatched.”6
