The same narrative was peddled in Moscow. On May 6, the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Deputy
Spokesman Alexey Zaitsev reaffirmed the fact that Russia would not use nuclear weapons in
Ukraine, but would do so only in accordance with the scenarios set out in its nuclear doctrine. “Scenarios for Russia’s possible use of nuclear weapons are clearly spelled out in Russian doctrine. They
are not applicable to tasks set in the special military operation in Ukraine,” emphasized Zaitsev. “Russia adheres to the principle that there can be no winners in a nuclear war and it must not be unleashed.”
