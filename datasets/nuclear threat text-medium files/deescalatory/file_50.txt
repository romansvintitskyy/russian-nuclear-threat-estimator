Boris Johnson made similar comments, explaining that he did not see a risk of Moscow using nuclear
weapons, even if the Russian military experienced further defeats. “Given the massive Russian backing for what [Putin] is doing, given the apparent obliviousness of the Russian media about what is really happening in Ukraine, the paradox is that Putin has far more political space to back down, to
withdraw,” explained Johnson.232 His Minister of the Armed Forces James Heappey added, Lavrov’s
nuclear allusions were the “sort of bravado” that had been his “trademark over the course of 15 years
or so.” There was no “imminent risk of escalation,” Heappey stressed. “What the West is doing to support its allies in Ukraine is very well calibrated,” though “it suits the Kremlin's narrative to claim that they are somehow in a confrontation with NATO,” he added.233 The risk of nuclear war was “vanishingly small.”234 Nor did Heappey see any particular risk of escalation should British weapons be used
against targets in Russia. “There are lots of countries around the world that operate kit that they have
imported from other countries; when those bits of kit are used we tend not to blame the country that
manufactured it, you blame the country that fired it,” he explained
