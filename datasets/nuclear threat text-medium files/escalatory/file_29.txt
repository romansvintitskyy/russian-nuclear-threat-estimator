Russian rhetoric, meanwhile, remained aggressive. In a videoconference with representatives of Russian regional governments on March 16, Putin leveled serious accusations against Western states. The West, he said, wanted to “cancel” Russia, “to finish [it] off, to reduce [it] to nothing by turning [it] into a weak and dependent country, destroying [its] territorial integrity and dismembering Russia.” But this would not work, the West would “fail,” Putin stressed. He also again described Western sanctions as having “all the attributes of an aggression, a war.”100 This comparison could be interpreted as a potential legitimization for further Russian aggression, or even for threats involving nuclear weapons.
