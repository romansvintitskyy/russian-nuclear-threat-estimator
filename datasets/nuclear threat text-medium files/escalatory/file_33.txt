The very next day, however, Russian officials again warned of a possible NATO-Russia confrontation
should there be a NATO peacekeeping mission in Ukraine. This “would be a very reckless and extremely dangerous decision,” Peskov explained. Any possible contact between Russian and NATO
forces “could have clear consequences that would be hard to repair,” he continued.113 Lavrov expressed similar sentiments: “This would be the direct clash between the Russian and NATO armed forces that everyone has not only tried to avoid but said should not take place in principle,” the Russian minister concluded.114 Later, on March 23, Medvedev said the United States had conspired to destroy Russia as part of a “primitive game” since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. The Kremlin would
never allow the destruction of Russia, he added, but warned Washington that if it did achieve what he
characterized as its destructive aims, then the world could face a dystopian crisis that would end in a
“big nuclear explosion.” Russia’s destruction could lead to an unstable leadership in Moscow “with a
maximum number of nuclear weapons aimed at targets in the United States and Europe.”115 Dmitry
Rogozin, the head of the state aerospace corporation, Roscosmos, said that Russia’s nuclear arsenal
would help deter the West from intervening in Ukraine. Russia was “capable of physically destroying
any aggressor or any aggressor group within minutes at any distance.”
