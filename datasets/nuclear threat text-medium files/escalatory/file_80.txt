The following day, July 12, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zakharova once again alluded to
the risk of nuclear escalation. “After provoking an escalation of the Ukrainian crisis and unleashing a
violent hybrid confrontation with Russia, Washington and its allies are dangerously teetering on the
brink of an open military confrontation with our country, which means a direct armed conflict between nuclear powers. Clearly, such a confrontation would be fraught with nuclear escalation,” Zakharova noted. At the same time, she denied Russia was threatening the use of nuclear weapons, criticizing a statement by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida as “anti-Russian.” She said: “It is
unacceptable to try to distort the logic of deterrence, which is what Russia’s official statements on nuclear issues are based on, for propaganda reasons, as well as to depict us as a country threatening to
use nuclear weapons.”
