The G7 states immediately responded to Moscow’s decision. On June 26-28, G7 leaders and representatives of the European Union met for a Summit in Germany.368 During a virtual address at the
Summit, Zelenskyy asked for more military assistance and suggested the war should end “before
winter sets in.”369 In a joint statement of support for Ukraine on June 27, the G7 leaders promised to
“continue to provide financial, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support and stand with Ukraine
for as long as it takes” and condemned Russian nuclear rhetoric. The G7 reiterated their “condemnation of Russia’s unjustified use of nuclear rhetoric and signaling.” Russia had to “abide by its international commitments, including those which ban the use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.”
The G7 urged “Russia to behave responsibly and exercise restraint, and reiterate that any use of such
weapons would be unacceptable and met with severe consequences. In this regard we express serious concern after the announcement by Russia that it could transfer missiles with nuclear capabilities
to Belarus.”
