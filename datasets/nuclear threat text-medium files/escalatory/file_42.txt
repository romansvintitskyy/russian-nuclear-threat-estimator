More Russian warnings occurred on April 14, as Medvedev once again pointed out the risks of Sweden and Finland joining NATO, which would “more than double” “the length of the alliance’s land borders with Russia.” Consequently, these borders would “have to be strengthened” and “no non-nuclear
status of the Baltics [would] be possible.” Hence: “The balance must be restored,” stressed Medvedev.
Specifically, this would mean “considerable” naval, ground and air defense forces, “increased tensions
along the borders, Iskanders, hypersonic weapons, and nuclear-armed ships ... at arm’s length” from
Sweden and Finland, he elaborated. “No sane person” could want this.
