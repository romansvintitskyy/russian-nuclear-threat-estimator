In parallel, also on April 28, Biden however appeared to implicitly acknowledge Russian concerns
over external interference in Ukraine. Even before the war he had “made clear” that Washington
would “[not] send US troops to fight Russian troops in Ukraine, but ... would provide robust military
assistance” and “try to unify the Western world against Russia’s aggression,” he explained. “Despite
the disturbing rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin, the facts are plain for everybody to see,” Biden declared. “We’re not attacking Russia; we’re helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression,”
including with significant intelligence and military assistance.
Yet, Biden rejected Russian claims that the war in Ukraine was a “life-or-death struggle” and a RussiaNATO “proxy war.” These statements were concerning, explained Biden, because they showed “the
desperation that Russia is feeling about their abject failure in being able to do what they set out to do
in the first instance.”
Instead of saying that the … Ukrainians, equipped with some capability to resist Russian forces,
are … [causing Moscow’s military failures in Ukraine], they’ve got to … tell their people the
United States and all of NATO is engaged … in taking out Russian troops and tanks. … It’s an excuse for their failure. But …no one should be making idle comments about the use of nuclear
weapons. … It’s irresponsible.
Asked whether he was concerned that Russia might start acting as if it was engaged in a proxy war
with Washington, Biden said the United States was “prepared for whatever they do.” However, the
United States would only send military assistance, not troops, to Ukraine.
