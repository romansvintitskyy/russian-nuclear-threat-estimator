On the same day, on March 23, US media reports suggested a marked hardening in US rhetoric regarding a potential Russian nuclear use. According to a Biden administration official, the US president
“remained adamant about keeping American forces out of Ukraine.” Yet “it would be misguided not to
closely examine the thresholds, if any, under which the president would reverse himself.” Even the
use of sub-strategic nuclear weapons inside Ukraine “would mean that ‘all bets are off’ on the United
States and NATO staying out of the war,” a senior official reportedly said. Similarly, Democratic Senator and Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed also suggested that a Russian attack with
chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine would have “consequences.”
A nuclear attack inside Ukraine could even “be considered an attack on a NATO member,” if nuclear
radiation were to be blown into a NATO state, he reportedly added. However, according to US officials, the Biden administration so far considered the likelihood of a nuclear attack to be low. Neither
the US nor NATO had observed any military actions indicating Russia was preparing a nuclear strike,
said a senior official. “We haven’t seen anything that’s made us adjust our posture, our nuclear posture,” National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also confirmed.
