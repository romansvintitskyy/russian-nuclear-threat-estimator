In the same vein, on June 25 at a meeting with Belarusian President Lukashenko in St. Petersburg,
Putin announced the transfer of nuclear-capable Iskander-M missiles to Belarus, as well as the reequipment of Belarusian SU-35 planes to carry nuclear weapons. The move was depicted as a reaction to Lithuania’s alleged plan “to stop transit from Russia to Kaliningrad” and to US and NATO exercises with nuclear capable aircraft. Lukashenko noted that Lithuania’s “plan to stop transit from Russia through Belarus to Kaliningrad” was “akin to declaring some kind of war.” When asking for
adapting Belarusian aircraft for nuclear use, he was not “talking about what we will transport tomorrow or whether they will transport nuclear weapons,” but he remembered “1941, when we were
lulled to sleep,” Lukashenko said. Putin answered that Russia was “obliged” to take care of the security of Belarus, and proposed that “the Belarusian army is armed with a fairly large group of Su-25
aircraft, they could be re-equipped accordingly.” Hence, “within the next few months we will transfer
to Belarus the Iskander-M tactical missile systems, which, as you know, can use both ballistic and
cruise missiles, both in conventional and nuclear versions.”
