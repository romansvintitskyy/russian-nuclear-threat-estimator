Nuclear narratives on Russian television once again developed their own dynamic. On Rossiya-1, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said on June 15 that he was certain that the US government
and “its military planners” were “characterized by the ideology of a limited nuclear war.” “The use of
nuclear weapons by the United States due to the crisis in Ukraine will become an irreversible event,
Russia rejects the concept of a limited nuclear strike. I hope that … the remnants of common sense
will allow these politicians, these applicants for the role of world conductors, to refrain from making
such decisions.” According to Ryabkov, Western countries “are trying to accuse us of allegedly playing
some kind of rhetorical game.” “This is completely untrue. These are useless arguments, but we are
used to the fact that the West has nothing left but distortion and fakes,” he stressed.3
