Washington was pursuing a “policy of containing Russia, with obvious geopolitical dividends,” Putin
added. However, NATO’s policy was for Russia “a matter of life and death.” The Western actions were
“not only a very real threat” to Russia’s interests but to “the very existence” of the state and to its
“sovereignty,” Putin said. Hence, he addressed “those who may be tempted to interfere in these developments from the outside,” saying that “no matter” who tried to stand in Russia’s way or “create
threats for our country and our people,” had to know that “Russia will respond immediately, and the
consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history” – what many interpreted as a veiled threat to employ nuclear weapons against those who interfered in Russia’s attempt to eliminate an existential threat.
