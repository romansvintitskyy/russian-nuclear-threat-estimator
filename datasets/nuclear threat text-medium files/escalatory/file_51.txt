In an April 27 briefing, Pentagon spokesperson Kirby condemned Russian nuclear rhetoric, including Lavrov’s recent remarks, as “irresponsible,” but refused to speculate on a potential Russian nuclear use.
Raising the specter of nuclear confrontation is irresponsible. It's certainly not what you would
expect from a modern nuclear power... Certainly, nobody wants to see, or nobody should want to
see it escalate into the nuclear realm. And there's no reason that it should. Mr. Putin can do the
right thing right now by ending the war, moving his forces out of Ukraine, sitting down in good
faith with President Zelensky and coming up with a negotiated settlement.. ... I'm not going to
again, speculate here about what Russia may or may not do with [tactical nuclear weapons] or
any other system. ... we’re monitoring [the nuclear threats] every single day as best, we can. And
we continue to see nothing that gives us cause to change our strategic nuclear deterrent posture. And we're confident that in our ability to defend the homeland from that perspective, as
well as our allies and partners.
In addition, Kirby confirmed Austin’s earlier statement that Washington did “[not] want to see Russia
in a position to be able to do [something like the invasion of Ukraine] again.” Instead it wanted “to see
Ukraine win” and “able to defend itself.” Russia should not be allowed to remain “in a position going
forward, where they haven't suffered consequences for this unprovoked invasion,” Kirby stressed.
