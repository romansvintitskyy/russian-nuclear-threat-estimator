Also on February 27, as a result of a foreign ministers’ meeting, the European Union announced the
delivery of weapons and lethal support to Ukraine worth 450 million euros. In a press conference, Josep Borrell, the European Union’s top diplomat, stated that this would include the delivery of fighter
jets, which Ukraine had asked for: “We are going to supply arms and even fighter jets. We are not talking just about ammunition; we are providing the most important arms to go to war,” Borell said. “We
know what kind of planes [the Ukrainian army can operate] and some Member States have these kinds of planes.”43 Borell was referring to fighter jets of the Soviet MiG or Sukhoi type, which for example Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia reportedly owned.44 Media later suggested
that several Western governments had hoped a potential delivery of fighter jets would not be made
public.
45 In addition, Borrell said Poland had agreed to act as a “logistical hub” for the delivery of such
“material assistance.”
