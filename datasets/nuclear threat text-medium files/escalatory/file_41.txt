The German government was not alone to worry about a potential escalation. Indeed on April 7, the
foreign ministers of the G7 countries and EU Foreign Affairs Representative Borrell adopted a statement warning against “any threat or use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.” They reminded
Russia of its “obligations under international treaties” and stressed that “any use by Russia of such a
weapon would be unacceptable and result in severe consequences.”
