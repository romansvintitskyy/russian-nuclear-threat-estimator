On June 3, Medvedev responded to the US decision to provide advanced rocket systems to Ukraine
in an interview, emphasizing that attacks on Russian territory could trigger retaliation against countries supplying these weapons. “If, God forbid, these weapons are used against Russian territory then
our armed forces will have no other choice but to strike decision-making centers,” he stressed. “Of
course, it needs to be understood that the final decision-making centers in this case, unfortunately,
are not located on the territory of Kyiv.” Medvedev also alluded to the risk of nuclear apocalypse suggesting that “the Horsemen of the Apocalypse are already on their way and all hope now is with Lord
God the Almighty
