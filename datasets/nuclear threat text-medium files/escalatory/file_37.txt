On March 26, Medvedev once again emphasized the expansive nature of Russia’s nuclear doctrine.
According to its own “special document on nuclear deterrence,” Moscow was “entitled” to use nuclear
weapons in four instances. The fourth case was when “an act of aggression” was “committed against
Russia and its allies, which jeopardized the existence of the country itself, even without the use of nuclear weapons, that is, with the use of conventional weapons.” The Russian government possessed a
“determination to defend the independence, sovereignty of our country, not to give anyone a reason to doubt even the slightest that we are ready to give a worthy response to any infringement on our
country, on its independence.”
