On April 20, Putin announced the successful test of a new nuclear-capable Sarmat intercontinental
ballistic missile. This, he said, was “a great and landmark event in the development of advanced
weapon systems in the Russian army.” There was “no” comparable system “in the world” and there
would not be any “for a long time to come,” Putin claimed. “This truly unique weapon will bolster the
combat capabilities of our Armed Forces, … reliably safeguard Russia’s security from external threats
and … make those who in the frenzy of rabid and aggressive rhetoric are trying to threaten our country think twice,” he added.217 Per the Russian Defense Ministry, however, the missile was still in a
“testing program” and would only become part of the Russian armed forces’ arsenal “after [its] completion.”
