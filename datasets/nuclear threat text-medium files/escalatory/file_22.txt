Putin warned on March 5 against the establishment of a no-fly zone. This would have “tremendous
and disastrous consequences” – “not only for Europe but also globally.” Russia would consider the
states seeking to impose a NFZ as parties to the conflict. Similar to Lavrov, Putin also claimed that
Ukraine was trying to obtain nuclear weapons and still had relevant capabilities from Soviet times. He
described the Western sanctions against Russia as tantamount to “war,” even though “thankfully” the
conflict had “not got” to a hot war “yet.” Putin explained that Russia’s “so-called partners” understood
what a NFZ “could lead to” and how much was at stake, “despite their reckless statements, for example, like the statement made by the UK Foreign Secretary, when she blurted out that NATO could get
involved in the conflict. And we immediately had to take a decision to put our deterrence forces on
high alert” (see Truss on February 27 and Lavrov’s statement on March 3)
