A month before the invasion, the Russian leadership started to bring its nuclear arsenal into the political narrative, already suggesting an expansive interpretation of the official doctrine. Dmitry
Medvedev, the Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council and a former president and prime
minister, stated in an interview on January 27, that there was no need to review Russia’s nuclear
doctrine. Moscow had “the right” to use strategic nuclear forces “in response to an attack involving
weapons of mass destruction against us or our allies and in response to any other threat to our country’s existence, in other words, to a danger that threatens the very existence of our state.” This was “a
comprehensive formula” that made it “possible to achieve various goals,” Medvedev said.
